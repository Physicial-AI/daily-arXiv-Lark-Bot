By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7cfb\u6570\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u978b\u5370\u5076\u7136\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cd5\u533b\u978b\u5370\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6cd5\u533b\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u978b\u5370\u8bc1\u636e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5339\u914d\u978b\u5b50\u7684\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u578b\u53f7\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5acc\u7591\u4eba\u7684\u978b\u5b50\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u540c\u6b3e\u978b\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u5343\u53cc\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u978b\u5e95\u4e0a\u7684\"\u5076\u7136\u7279\u5f81\"\uff08\u5982\u5207\u5272\u3001\u522e\u75d5\u7b49\u78e8\u635f\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u6765\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u978b\u5b50\u3002\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5076\u7136\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\u533b\u8bc1\u636e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5d4c\u5957\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6ce8\u91ca\u978b\u5370\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7cfb\u6570\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u978b\u5e95\u82b1\u7eb9\u56fe\u6848\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u7279\u5f81\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cd5\u533b\u978b\u5370\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u978b\u5370\u5076\u7136\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6cd5\u533b\u978b\u5370\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u975e\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6377\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u975e\u9884\u671f\u8bc1\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5e38\u504f\u79bb\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u5f53\u5f52\u56e0\u533a\u57df\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u5148\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5bf9\u975e\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5236\u5f52\u56e0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u70b9\u51fb\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u671f\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

This accessibility creates an opportunity to study how quantitative retinal phenotypes relate to ocular and systemic diseases. However, such analyses remain difficult at scale due to the limited availability of public multi-label datasets and the lack of a unified segmentation-to-quantification pipeline. We present RetSAM, a general retinal segmentation and quantification framework for fundus imaging. It delivers robust multi-target segmentation and standardized biomarker extraction, supporting downstream ophthalmologic studies and oculomics correlation analyses. Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes. Trained with a multi-stage strategy using both private and public fundus data, RetSAM achieves superior segmentation performance on 17 public datasets. It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings.

In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems.

These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAttractor Patch Networks (APN)\u4f5c\u4e3aTransformer\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8def\u7531\u9009\u62e9top-k\u4e13\u5bb6\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u7684FFN\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6240\u6709token\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u6743\u91cd\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "APN\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u8865\u4e01\u5e93\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8def\u7531\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u9009\u62e9top-k\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8865\u4e01\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d27\u51d1\u7f16\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0cAPN\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6(4.57 vs 4.32 PPL)\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\uff1a\u539f\u59cb\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53472.6\u500d(11.1 vs 29.4 PPL)\uff0c\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53472.8\u500d(6.4 vs 17.8 PPL)\u3002", "conclusion": "APN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Transformer\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we firstly explore the challenges mentioned above and develop \\textbf{C}onfigurable \\textbf{R}efusal in \\textbf{VLM}s (\\textbf{CR-VLM}), a robust and efficient approach for {\\em configurable} refusal based on activation steering. CR-VLM consists of three integrated components: (1) extracting a configurable refusal vector via a teacher-forced mechanism to amplify the refusal signal; (2) introducing a gating mechanism that mitigates over-refusal by preserving acceptance for in-scope queries; and (3) designing a counterfactual vision enhancement module that aligns visual representations with refusal requirements. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and various VLMs demonstrate that CR-VLM achieves effective, efficient, and robust configurable refusals, offering a scalable path toward user-adaptive safety alignment in VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "CR-VLM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8981\u4e48\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u8db3\u8981\u4e48\u62d2\u7edd\u8fc7\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u62d2\u7edd\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u62d2\u7edd\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5404\u79cdVLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCR-VLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u4e3aVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "CR-VLM\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

In this work, we present Neural Sabermetrics with World Model, a Large Language Model (LLM) based play-by-play world model for baseball. We cast baseball games as long auto-regressive sequences of events and continuously pretrain a single LLM on more than ten years of Major League Baseball (MLB) tracking data, comprising over seven million pitch sequences and approximately three billion tokens. The resulting model is capable of predicting multiple aspects of game evolution within a unified framework. We evaluate our model on both in-distribution regular-season data and out-of-distribution postseason games and compare against strong neural baselines from prior work. Despite using a single backbone model, our approach outperforms the performance of existing baselines, (1) correctly predicting approximately 64% of next pitches within a plate appearance and (2) 78% of batter swing decisions, suggesting that LLMs can serve as effective world models for sports.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Neural Sabermetrics with World Model\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68d2\u7403\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6295\u7403\u548c\u51fb\u7403\u5458\u6325\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68d2\u7403\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u56de\u987e\u5206\u6790\u5f88\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u9010\u7403\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u9010\u7403\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u68d2\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc710\u5e74MLB\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff08700\u4e07\u6295\u7403\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ea630\u4ebftokens\uff09\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5e38\u89c4\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5b63\u540e\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ea664%\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u6295\u7403\uff08\u5728\u6253\u5e2d\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca78%\u7684\u51fb\u7403\u5458\u6325\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f53\u80b2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u68d2\u7403\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

When facing context-dense product imagery and multimodal defects, current reference-based methods (e.g., SSIM, FID) lack explainability, while model-as-judge approaches lack domain-grounded, fine-grained reward signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance.

We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion.

This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices.

While other survey papers focus on the healthcare supply chain, operations, and medical emergency response aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive review of medical drones from the perspectives of flight dynamics and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations.

Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset.

The Image Matching Challenge 2025 (IMC2025) highlights these difficulties by requiring both scene discovery and camera pose estimation under real-world conditions, including outliers and mixed content. This paper investigates the application of Gaussian-constrained representations inspired by LeJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to address these challenges. We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings. These findings suggest that theoretically motivated representation constraints offer a promising direction for bridging self-supervised learning principles and practical structure-from-motion pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9IMC2025\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLeJEPA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u573a\u666f\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002IMC2025\u6311\u6218\u8981\u6c42\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u573a\u666f\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u91c7\u7528\u53d7LeJEPA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u6539\u5584\u805a\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728IMC2025\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u573a\u666f\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u5927\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u534a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u89c4\u8303\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Project page: https://avere-iclr.github.io", "summary": "Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings.

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "XAI-CLIP\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684ROI\u5f15\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u68af\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faXAI-CLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fb9\u754c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLARE22\u548cCHAOS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1160%\uff0cDice\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534744.6%\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7684IoU\u63d0\u9ad896.7%\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\uff0c\u4f2a\u5f71\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u6574\u5408\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684XAI\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u65e0GPS\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u3001\u672a\u6620\u5c04\u6216GPS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728Habitat AI\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5c0f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6613\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

M. Shihab", "Jonathan King"], "title": "Deep Learning Based Multi-Level Classification for Aviation Safety", "comment": null, "summary": "Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, often resulting in loss of life, severe aircraft damage, and substantial financial costs. Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u79cd\u3001\u9e1f\u7fa4\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u822a\u7a7a\u9e1f\u51fb\u9884\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9e1f\u51fb\u5bf9\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9e1f\u51fb\u9884\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9e1f\u7c7b\u96f7\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u79cd\u3002\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u9e1f\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u98de\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002CNN\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u79cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684CNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u9e1f\u7fa4\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u9e1f\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u79cd\u3001\u9e1f\u7fa4\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8865\u5145\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9e1f\u7fa4\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e86\u89e3\u96c6\u4f53\u98de\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6563\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9e1f\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u649e\u51fb\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u79cd\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9e1f\u51fb\u9884\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4PID\u548c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7cbe\u786e\u5904\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u4eea\u5668\u548c\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd0\u8f93\u88c5\u6709\u5371\u9669\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u7684\u6613\u788e\u73bb\u7483\u5bb9\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7a81\u53d8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u7a33\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6296\u632f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0ePID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "MBSMC\u76f8\u6bd4PID\u548cNMBSMC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u5bb9\u5668\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u7a97\u6237\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u5728PID\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator.

We argue that this formulation is inefficient and lacks the structural inductive bias necessary for distinguishing between local feature preservation and global context integration. To address this, we introduce the Hybrid Dual-Path Linear (HDPL) operator, which decomposes the affine transformation into two topologically distinct pathways: a sparse block-diagonal component for high-rank local processing, and a low-rank Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck for global context regularization. By \"surgically\" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu dataset demonstrate that the HDPL architecture outperforms a standard Llama-style baseline, reducing validation loss while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 6.8%. Beyond immediate performance gains, we discuss how the explicit materialization of a probabilistic latent space within the Transformer backbone serves as a vital architectural affordance, offering new pathways for inference-time or hypernetwork induced control, continual adaptation, interpretability, and cross-model or cross-modal synchronization.

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faReVision\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ReAlign\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5360\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u79fb\u533a\u57df\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faReAlign\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u3001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u8d28\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e09\u6b65\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8eReAlign\u63d0\u51faReVision\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6574\u5408ReAlign\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e3aMLLMs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f02\u5e38\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications.

To mitigate this, a baseline is commonly introduced for advantage computation; however, traditional value models remain difficult to optimize, and standard group-based baselines overlook sequence heterogeneity. Although classic optimal baseline theory can achieve global variance reduction, it neglects token heterogeneity and requires prohibitive gradient-based computation. In this work, we derive the Optimal Token Baseline (OTB) from first principles, proving that gradient updates should be weighted inversely to their cumulative gradient norm. To ensure efficiency, we propose the Logit-Gradient Proxy that approximates the gradient norm using only forward-pass probabilities. Our method achieves training stability and matches the performance of large group sizes ($N=32$) with only $N=4$, reducing token consumption by over 65% across single-turn and tool-integrated reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOptimal Token Baseline (OTB)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u6765\u51cf\u5c11RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Logit-Gradient Proxy\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u7206\u70b8\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u53c8\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86token\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faOptimal Token Baseline (OTB)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5e94\u8be5\u6309\u7d2f\u79ef\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u7684\u5012\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLogit-Gradient Proxy\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6982\u7387\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528N=4\u7684\u7ec4\u5927\u5c0f\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230N=32\u7ec4\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc765%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "OTB\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651token\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to improve robustness using only unlabeled test samples, yet most prompt-based TTA methods rely on entropy minimization -- an approach that can amplify spurious correlations and induce overconfident errors when classes share visual features. We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fair Context Learning (FCL) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u8bc1\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u8bc1\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FCL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u516c\u5e73\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u5e73\u7b49\u5316\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660eFCL\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FCL\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u8bc1\u636e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept.

Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets. The proposed method maintains a favorable balance between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications.

However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks.

While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity.\n  To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u8868\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MT-MIA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7528\u6237\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u8868\u653b\u51fb\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u8868\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5173\u7cfb\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u8868\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u8868\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MT-MIA\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u7528\u6237\u6240\u6709\u5173\u8054\u8868\u9879\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7531\u8868\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5c42\u9762\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "MT-MIA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u5c42\u9762\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002MT-MIA\u80fd\u6bd4\u5355\u8868\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6cc4\u9732\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002MT-MIA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u8868\u653b\u51fb\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising potential for performing end-to-end KIE directly from document images. To enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across realistic and diverse application scenarios, we introduce UNIKIE-BENCH, a unified benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the KIE capabilities of LMMs. UNIKIE-BENCH consists of two complementary tracks: a constrained-category KIE track with scenario-predefined schemas that reflect practical application needs, and an open-category KIE track that extracts any key information that is explicitly present in the document. Experiments on 15 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial performance degradation under diverse schema definitions, long-tail key fields, and complex layouts, along with pronounced performance disparities across different document types and scenarios. These findings underscore persistent challenges in grounding accuracy and layout-aware reasoning for LMM-based KIE.

We present Landscaper, an open-source Python package for arbitrary-dimensional loss landscape analysis. Landscaper combines Hessian-based subspace construction with topological data analysis to reveal geometric structures such as basin hierarchy and connectivity. A key component is the Saddle-Minimum Average Distance (SMAD) for quantifying landscape smoothness. We demonstrate Landscaper's effectiveness across various architectures and tasks, including those involving pre-trained language models, showing that SMAD captures training transitions, such as landscape simplification, that conventional metrics miss. We also illustrate Landscaper's performance in challenging chemical property prediction tasks, where SMAD can serve as a metric for out-of-distribution generalization, offering valuable insights for model diagnostics and architecture design in data-scarce scientific machine learning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Landscaper\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\u7684Python\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Hessian\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SMAD\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u7ef4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u590d\u6742\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5982\u76c6\u5730\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Landscaper\u5f00\u6e90Python\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u6784\u5efa\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Saddle-Minimum Average Distance (SMAD)\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "Landscaper\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002SMAD\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5982\u666f\u89c2\u7b80\u5316\u3002\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSMAD\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "Landscaper\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002SMAD\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals.

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable.

The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u5f0f\u98de\u673a\u5e94\u6025\u7740\u9646\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u6025\u7740\u9646\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u98de\u673a\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5730\u9762\u4eba\u53e3\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eADS-B\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u70ed\u56fe\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7a7a\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u533a\u57df\u66b4\u9732\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u98de\u8d8a\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7740\u9646\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5c0f\u98ce\u9669Dubins\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u603b\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5e73\u57472.9\u79d2\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u6025\u7740\u9646\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u52a0\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e94\u6025\u89c4\u5212"}}

Victoria Velasco"], "title": "Featured Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces for Learning and Neural Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces provide a foundational framework for kernel-based learning, where regularization and interpolation problems admit finite-dimensional solutions through classical representer theorems. Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5df4\u62ff\u8d6b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6db5\u76d6\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u914d\u5907\u975e\u4e8c\u6b21\u8303\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u5728\u5df4\u62ff\u8d6b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5df4\u62ff\u8d6b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u4f53\u5236\u4e4b\u5916\u6062\u590d\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u6838\u6784\u9020\u548c\u8868\u793a\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u8303\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5df4\u62ff\u8d6b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5df4\u62ff\u8d6b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6b64\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5df4\u62ff\u8d6b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant.

The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs).

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB.

Despite the promise of deep learning for automating MFL interpretation, progress toward reliable models has been constrained by the absence of a large-scale public dataset and benchmark, making fair comparison and reproducible evaluation difficult. We introduce \\textbf{PipeMFL-240K}, a large-scale, meticulously annotated dataset and benchmark for complex object detection in pipeline MFL pseudo-color images. PipeMFL-240K reflects real-world inspection complexity and poses several unique challenges: (i) an extremely long-tailed distribution over \\textbf{12} categories, (ii) a high prevalence of tiny objects that often comprise only a handful of pixels, and (iii) substantial intra-class variability. The dataset contains \\textbf{240,320} images and \\textbf{191,530} high-quality bounding-box annotations, collected from 11 pipelines spanning approximately \\textbf{1,480} km. Extensive experiments are conducted with state-of-the-art object detectors to establish baselines. Results show that modern detectors still struggle with the intrinsic properties of MFL data, highlighting considerable headroom for improvement, while PipeMFL-240K provides a reliable and challenging testbed to drive future research.

Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2\u00b0 in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08CR\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08ToF\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8f6f\u4f53\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u4f53\u79ef\u8fc7\u5927\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5efa\u56fe\u7814\u7a76\u51e0\u4e4e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ecf\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u572853\u5398\u7c73\u957f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e2.5\u5398\u7c73\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c7.2\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\uff09\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u91cd\u590d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u56fe\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, the dynamics can be empirically convex-like across various tasks, models, optimizers, hyperparameters, etc. In this work, we examine the applicability of convexity and Lipschitz continuity in deep learning, in order to precisely control the loss dynamics via the learning rate schedules. We illustrate that deep learning quickly becomes weakly convex after a short period of training, and the loss is predicable by an upper bound on the last iterate, which further informs the scaling of optimal learning rate. Through the lens of convexity, we build scaling laws of learning rates and losses that extrapolate as much as 80X across training horizons and 70X across model sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u540e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5448\u73b0\u5f31\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u63a7\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u635f\u5931\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u51f8\u6027\u548cLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u540e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u4e3a\u5f31\u51f8\u3002\u5229\u7528\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u754c\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u635f\u5931\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5448\u73b0\u5f31\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6307\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\uff0880\u500d\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\uff0870\u500d\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51f8\u6027\u548cLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u63a7\u5236\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Developing such agents requires diverse, large-scale datasets. Prior frameworks generate synthetic data for long-term human-robot interactions but fail to model the bidirectional influence between human behavior and household environments. Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.\n  The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods. Our flexible tool allows users to define dataset characteristics via natural language prompts, enabling configuration of environment and human activity data through natural language specifications. The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.\n  We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences.

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u5206\u6790\u548cpass@k\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97pass@1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u5927\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u566a\u97f3\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u5728SWE-Bench-Verified\u4e0a\u6536\u96c6\u4e8660,000\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5206\u6b67\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884cpass@1\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u5dee\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u54ea\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u53162.2\u52306.0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e3a0\u65f6\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u4e5f\u8d85\u8fc71.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u65e9\u671f\uff08\u524d\u51e0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684token\uff09\u5c31\u51fa\u73b0\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u5c0f\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u7ea7\u8054\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4e09\u9879\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u8df5\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1pass@1\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u671f\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6b21\u6570\uff1b3) \u8003\u8651\u4f7f\u7528k>1\u7684pass@k\uff08\u4e50\u89c2\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u548cpass^k\uff08\u60b2\u89c2\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u6307\u6807\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u566a\u97f3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShapBPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u5272\u6811\uff08BPT\uff09\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u914dShapley\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "ShapBPT\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06Shapley\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u2014\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u5272\u6811\uff08BPT\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u5272\u786e\u4fdd\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eShapBPT\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709XCV\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u300220\u540d\u88ab\u8bd5\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u504f\u597dShapBPT\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapBPT\u5c06\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot.

We propose a matching framework that selects samples relative to an adaptive centroid and iteratively refines the representation distribution. The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings. Most importantly, we show that these improvements translate to zero-shot medical anomaly detection, one of the extreme forms of data heterogeneity and asymmetry.

Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faECHWR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u65f6\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u624b\u5199\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u624b\u5199\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "method": "\u63d0\u51faECHWR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u65f6\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u6279\u5185\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931", "result": "\u5728OnHW-Words500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5728writer-independent\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e7.4%\uff0c\u5728writer-dependent\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e10.4%", "conclusion": "ECHWR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4e66\u5199\u98ce\u683c"}}

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling.

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\"\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\"\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u6b64\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4f46\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u505a\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d88\u878d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\"\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\"\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6b64\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8fbe\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u6807\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5373\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u800c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u53ea\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u5f0f\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8868\u793a"}}

This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\\%$ overall grasp success rate.

We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines.

Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neural Sentinel\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b8c\u6210\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea692.3%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfOCR\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfALPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b+OCR\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528PaliGemma 3B\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee570:30\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6df7\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u738792.3%\uff0c\u6bd4EasyOCR\u63d0\u534714.1%\uff0c\u6bd4PaddleOCR\u63d0\u53479.9%\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf152ms\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee0.048\u3002\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u8f66\u8f86\u989c\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b89%\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u68c0\u6d4b82%\u3001\u4e58\u5458\u8ba1\u657078%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86ALPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs.", "AI": {"tldr": "UEREBot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u6162\u901f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u53cd\u5c04\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u5766\u5730\u5f62\u901a\u884c\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u969c\u3002\u5355\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u592a\u6162\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u901a\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUEREBot\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u84dd\u56fe\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u5a01\u80c1\u611f\u77e5\u5207\u6362\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b4) \u91c7\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u6267\u884c\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u5728Isaac Lab\u4eff\u771f\u548cUnitree Go2\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cUEREBot\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u907f\u969c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "UEREBot\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5c55\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Traditional systems, however, rely on subject-mounted markers that require manual registration, may shift during procedures, and can cause discomfort. We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01\u00b0$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results. The results suggest that integration of the data from the various camera sensors can improve the overall accuracy further. The proposed markerless neuronavigation methods can reduce setup cost and complexity, improve patient comfort, and expand access to neuronavigation in clinical and research settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u572850\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec52.32\u6beb\u7c73\u548c2.01\u00b0\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u7ecf\u9885\u78c1\u523a\u6fc0\u6240\u9700\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u79fb\u4f4d\u3001\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u9002\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4fbf\u6377\u8212\u9002\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u76f8\u673a\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec52.32\u6beb\u7c73\u548c2.01\u00b0\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ecf\u9885\u78c1\u523a\u6fc0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u60a3\u8005\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "TF-DP\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5386\u53f2\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ac\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u805a\u7126\u573a\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTF-DP\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u534780.56%\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u534786.11%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4ec5\u589e\u52a06.4%\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u539f\u7406\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Traditional top-down methods often overlook public input, creating a gap in design aspirations and reality. Recent advancements in digital tools, like City Information Modelling and augmented reality, have enabled a more participatory process involving more stakeholders in urban design. Further, deep learning and latent diffusion models have lowered barriers for design generation, providing even more opportunities for participatory urban design. Combining state-of-the-art latent diffusion models with interactive semantic segmentation, we propose RECITYGEN, a novel tool that allows users to interactively create variational street view images of urban environments using text prompts.

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08UBMs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u521a\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548cTransformer\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6307\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u521a\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08UBMs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7075\u5de7\u6280\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u73af\u5883\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\uff09\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0Koopman-UBM\uff0c\u5229\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6d41\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\"\u60f3\u8c61\"\u6574\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff0c\u5f53\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u5dee\u5f02\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u548c2\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cK-UBM\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u3001\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UBMs\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6280\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002Koopman-UBM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, safety concerns remain when these methods are deployed on real-world applications, necessitating risk-aware agents. A common utility for learning such risk-aware agents is the entropic risk measure, but current policy gradient methods optimizing this measure must perform high-variance and numerically unstable updates. As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings. Motivated by theory, we propose risk-sensitive exponential actor-critic (rsEAC), an off-policy model-free approach that incorporates novel procedures to avoid the explicit representation of exponential value functions and their gradients, and optimizes its policy w.r.t the entropic risk measure.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data.

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97do-Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "do-Shapley\u503c\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u9879\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06do-Shapley\u503c\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e95\u5c42SCM\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5f53\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u6570\u91cfr\u5df2\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9884\u7b97\u63a5\u8fd1r\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(r)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dr\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u4eced\u52302^d\uff1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u63a5\u8fd1r\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u51fa\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\u8981\u6c42\u4ece\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u4ec5d\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u7d20\u8054\u76df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u7684do-Shapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u8981\u6c42\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684SCM\u3002"}}

Today, the share of non-metallic inclusions (contamination) is judged visually by inspectors - an approach that is subjective and hazardous due to dust and moving machinery. We present an assistive computer vision pipeline that estimates contamination (per percent) from images captured during railcar unloading and also classifies scrap type. The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL). Best results include MAE 0.27 and R2 0.83 by MIL; and an MTL setup reaches MAE 0.36 with F1 0.79 for scrap class. Also we present the system in near real time within the acceptance workflow: magnet/railcar detection segments temporal layers, a versioned inference service produces railcar-level estimates with confidence scores, and results are reviewed by operators with structured overrides; corrections and uncertain cases feed an active-learning loop for continual improvement.

However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

Ratliff"], "title": "Online Learning for Uninformed Markov Games: Empirical Nash-Value Regret and Non-Stationarity Adaptation", "comment": "36 pages", "summary": "We study online learning in two-player uninformed Markov games, where the opponent's actions and policies are unobserved. In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.\n  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(\u03b7C + \\sqrt{K/\u03b7})$ regret bound, where $\u03b7$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $\u03b7$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u4eba\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u9057\u61be\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bf9\u624b\u65f6\u6062\u590dO(\u221aK)\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590dO(K^{2/3})\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u9057\u61be\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(\u221aK)\u901f\u7387\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9057\u61be\u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6bd4\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u9057\u61be\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e14\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u81ea\u7136\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Mao\u7b49\u4eba(2022)\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5468\u671f\u7684V-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbO(\u03b7C + \u221aK/\u03b7)\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u542f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u03b7\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230O(min{\u221aK + (CK)^{1/3}, \u221aLK})\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dC\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0cL\u8868\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u5bf9\u624b\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u7684O(\u221aK)\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684O(K^{2/3})\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u9057\u61be\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9057\u61be\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

To inject explicit physical knowledge, we build a physical data engine with two components. FysicsAny produces physics-grounded instruction--image supervision by mapping salient objects to verified physical attributes through hierarchical retrieval over a curated prototype database, followed by physics-law--constrained verification and caption rewriting.

Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations. Extensive real-world demonstrations validate its practical utility.

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

Conventional approaches to the assessment of image displacement and non-contact material probing typically rely on time-consuming iterative algorithms for non-rigid image registration and constitutive modelling using discretization and iterative numerical solving techniques, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM), which are not suitable for high-throughput data processing. Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5149\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u9636\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u6da1\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4d\u79fb\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with this form of task-level reasoning. They either depend on prompt-based in-context decomposition, which is unstable and sensitive to linguistic variations, or end-to-end long-horizon training, which requires large-scale demonstrations and entangles task-level reasoning with low-level control. We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "iSTAR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u89e3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u4e14\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u8026\u5408", "method": "\u63d0\u51fain-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0ciSTAR\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aefVLA\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u5316\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal.

We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bird-SR \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Bird-SR \u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u65e9\u671f\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u540e\u671f\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u5956\u52b1\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u9632\u6b62\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\uff1b4\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6-\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBird-SR \u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Bird-SR \u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Unlike humans, a physical robot can simultaneously present different identities and have them reside and control different parts of the robot. This paper presents a novel study that investigates how users perceive a robot where different robot control domains (head and gripper) are presented as independent robots. We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant. Participants perceived the robot as residing in the different control domains and were able to associate robot failure with different identities.

We ask whether, beyond producing good tours, a trained TSP solver learns internal representations that transfer to other optimization-relevant objectives, in the spirit of transfer learning from other domains. We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to study neural TSP solvers as transferable encoders for prescriptive what-if decision-support objectives beyond tour construction. Finally, we show that transfer accuracy increases with solver quality across training and model scale, suggesting that training stronger NCO solvers also yields more useful encoders for downstream objectives.

In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMosaicThinker\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5e27\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u5e27\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u5e27\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u8bbe\u5907", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMosaicThinker\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u4ece\u591a\u5e27\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcVLM\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5177\u8eabAI\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u8de8\u5e27\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1", "conclusion": "MosaicThinker\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5c0f\u578bVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8de8\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations.

However, these models often face challenges when dealing with implicit editing instructions, which describe the cause of a visual change without explicitly detailing the resulting outcome. These limitations arise because existing models rely on uniform editing strategies that are not equipped to handle the complex world knowledge and reasoning required for implicit instructions. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic.

With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward.

The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation.

By further establishing a general reduction from the maximum to the median, our results break a barrier suggested by prior work on the maximum function, which indicated that linear width should require depth growing at least as $\\log\\log d$ to achieve comparable accuracy.

However, existing approaches operate in raster space and rely on post hoc vectorization, which introduces structural inconsistencies and hinders end-to-end learning. Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors.

Recognizing symmetrical features or axes within an object helps in developing efficient grasp strategies, as grasping along these axes typically results in a more stable and balanced grip, thereby facilitating successful manipulation. This paper employs geometrical moments to identify symmetries and estimate orthogonal transformations, including rotations and mirror transformations, for objects centered at the frame origin. It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \\( n \\)-tuples. Extensive validation tests are conducted on both 2D and 3D objects to ensure the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach.

However, it is severely bottlenecked by the increasing memory demands of its KV cache. Previous works have shown that self-speculative decoding with sparse attention, where tokens are drafted using a subset of the KV cache and verified in parallel with full KV cache, speeds up inference in a lossless way. However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification. In this paper, we propose SpecAttn, a self-speculative decoding method with verification-guided sparse attention. SpecAttn identifies critical KV entries as a byproduct of verification and only loads these entries when drafting subsequent tokens. This not only improves draft token acceptance rate but also incurs low KV selection overhead, thereby improving decoding throughput.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u71673D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u5ba4\u5916\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523010m/s\u7684\u907f\u969c\u98de\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u5ba4\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u9762\u4e34\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5149\u7167\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u71673D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u573a\u666f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u3001\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5728\u590d\u6742\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe10m/s\uff0c\u5bf9\u5267\u70c8\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u71673D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u548c\u5149\u7167\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u5ba4\u5916\u73af\u5883\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots.

However, the dynamic nature of emerging AI applications, the continual introduction of new datasets, and the growing number of models claiming superior performance make efficient and reliable validation of model services increasingly challenging. This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\\varepsilon}$.

When MLLMs reason over camera-captured views of the physical world, a new attack surface emerges: an attacker can place text-bearing physical objects in the environment to override MLLMs' intended task. While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories.

Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "USER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0eGPU\u540c\u7b49\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u3001\u5ec9\u4ef7\u91cd\u7f6e\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u786c\u4ef6\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b2. \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u9762\u652f\u6301\u96a7\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u901a\u9053\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u591a\u5904\u7406\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\u540c\u6b65\uff1b3. \u5b8c\u5168\u5f02\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\u914d\u5408\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff1b4. \u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0cUSER\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5f02\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "USER\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We introduce an inference-time, cerebellar-inspired residual control framework that augments a frozen reinforcement learning policy with online corrective actions, enabling fault recovery without modifying base policy parameters. The framework instantiates core cerebellar principles, including high-dimensional pattern separation via fixed feature expansion, parallel microzone-style residual pathways, and local error-driven plasticity with excitatory and inhibitory eligibility traces operating at distinct time scales. These mechanisms enable fast, localized correction under post-training disturbances while avoiding destabilizing global policy updates. A conservative, performance-driven meta-adaptation regulates residual authority and plasticity, preserving nominal behavior and suppressing unnecessary intervention.

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ex-Omni\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u652f\u67b6\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684token-as-query\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u8bed\u97f3\u4f34\u968f\u76843D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u5f88\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u79bb\u6563token\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEx-Omni\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u652f\u67b6\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684token-as-query\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86InstructEx\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEx-Omni\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "Ex-Omni\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy.

In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6545\u969c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6545\u969c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u6cbf\u7740\u611f\u77e5-\u91cd\u5efa\u6267\u884c\u94fe\u88ab\u9010\u6b65\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b89\u88c5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u7b49\u73af\u8282\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u8026\u5408\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u89e3\u6790\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u8981\u654f\u611f\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8d85\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8bef\u5dee\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u540c\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u9519\u4f4d\u5728\u5178\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u8d77\u6b21\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53f0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u653e\u5927\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size.

While prior work has sought to mitigate these shifts by using self-supervised regularization with paired longitudinal data, such data are often unavailable in practice. To address this, we propose \\emph{DuMeta++}, a dual meta-learning framework that operates without paired longitudinal data. Our approach integrates: (1) meta-feature learning to extract age-agnostic semantic representations of spatiotemporally evolving brain structures, and (2) meta-initialization learning to enable data-efficient adaptation of the segmentation model. Furthermore, we propose a memory-bank-based class-aware regularization strategy to enforce longitudinal consistency without explicit longitudinal supervision.

In this paper, we present a geometric error propagation framework for camera pose estimation based on a parallel perspective approximation. By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec33D\u5934\u90e8GAN\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5934\u90e83D GAN\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cbf\u7740\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u5411\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u975e\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u5934\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c063D\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u5411\u89e3\u8026\u30022. \u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5934\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528FLUX.1 Kontext\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u9762\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u30023. \u4ece\u6b63\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u50cfclip\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u5934\u90e8\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5355\u89c6\u56feGAN\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u5141\u8bb8\u540c\u4e00\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u62103D\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u5934\u90e8GAN\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u6837\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u63a5\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u6765\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6b65\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea630%\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5efa\u56fe\uff0c\u5730\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6b65\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u63a5\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7eb3\u5165\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea630%\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While recent advances enable batching (co-locating) multiple adapters during serving, efficient training-time co-location of heterogeneous LoRA adapters presents unique challenges. Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and na\u00efve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters. At the scheduling layer, tLoRA incorporates an online, residual-capacity-aware scheduler that adaptively groups jobs to maximize collective throughput.

To fill this gap, we introduce RoadSafe365, a large-scale vision-language benchmark that supports fine-grained analysis of traffic safety from extensive and diverse real-world video data collections. Unlike prior works that focus primarily on coarse accident identification, RoadSafe365 is independently curated and systematically organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that refines and extends foundational definitions of crash, incident, and violation to bridge official traffic safety standards with data-driven traffic understanding systems. RoadSafe365 provides rich attribute annotations across diverse traffic event types, environmental contexts, and interaction scenarios, yielding 36,196 annotated clips from both dashcam and surveillance cameras.

This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7QUBO\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8986\u76d6-\u91cd\u53e0\u6743\u8861\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u8f66\u8f86\u53ca\u5176\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u91cd\u53e0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eNP\u96be\u6027\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfc\u4e8c\u6b21\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4f18\u5316\uff08QUBO\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u552f\u4e00\u8986\u76d6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u91cd\u53e0\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1b3. \u533a\u5206\u8f6f\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u786c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1b4. \u5efa\u7acb\u57ce\u5e02\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5019\u9009\u8def\u7ebf\u6784\u5efa\u3001QUBO\u77e9\u9635\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b5. \u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08Gurobi\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u548cD-Wave\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u6700\u591a10,000\u8f86\u8f66\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff1a1. \u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8986\u76d6-\u91cd\u53e0\u6743\u8861\u62d0\u70b9\uff1b2. \u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u786c\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\uff1b3.

However, these SR models introduce a previously unexplored attack surface into imaging pipelines. In this paper, we present AdvSR, a framework demonstrating that adversarial behavior can be embedded directly into SR model weights during training, requiring no access to inputs at inference time. Unlike prior attacks that perturb inputs or rely on backdoor triggers, AdvSR operates entirely at the model level. By jointly optimizing for reconstruction quality and targeted adversarial outcomes, AdvSR produces models that appear benign under standard image quality metrics while inducing downstream misclassification. We evaluate AdvSR on three SR architectures (SRCNN, EDSR, SwinIR) paired with a YOLOv11 classifier and demonstrate that AdvSR models can achieve high attack success rates with minimal quality degradation. These findings highlight a new model-level threat for imaging pipelines, with implications for how practitioners source and validate models in safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdvSR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u770b\u4f3c\u826f\u6027\u7684SR\u6a21\u578b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u50cf\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u524d\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdvSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6297\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165SR\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bbf\u95ee\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u5374\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cdSR\u67b6\u6784\uff08SRCNN\u3001EDSR\u3001SwinIR\uff09\u4e0eYOLOv11\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u914d\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAdvSR\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AdvSR\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u8d2d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u9192\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6210\u50cf\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible.

To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u666f\u5185\u5bb9\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5AdaPort\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982VR/AR\uff09\u5bf9\u5e27\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u7269\u7406-\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u540c\u6b65\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u7ea7\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7528\u6237\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u540e\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5019\u9009\u90e8\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u800c\u975e\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86AdaPort\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9057\u61be\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9057\u61be\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaPort\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdaPort\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u800c\u975e\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u548cAdaPort\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u5185\u5bb9\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By embedding images into a transport domain via invertible transformations, TBM facilitates effective classification, regression, and other tasks using transport-domain features. Crucially, the inverse mapping enables the projection of analytic results back into the original image space, allowing researchers to directly interpret clinical features associated with model outputs in a spatially meaningful way. To facilitate broader adoption of TBM in clinical imaging research, we present 3D-TBM, a tool designed for morphological analysis of 3D medical images.

Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f62\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u8db3\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u53bb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5728\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u5165\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u5bf9\u3002\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u7a0b\u56fe\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8db3\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While many prior approaches mitigate this effect through architectural modifications or residual mechanisms, the underlying spectral cause of oversmoothing is often left implicit. We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved. Our results show that oversmoothing is a depth-dependent spectral phenomenon that can be systematically delayed through modest, low-rank adaptation of the graph propagation operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLaplacian-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u8c31\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdfGCN\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u591a\u4e24\u500d", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u6b8b\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8c31\u539f\u56e0\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u9690\u542b\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaplacian-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6GCN\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u8c31\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c31\u951a\u5b9a\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u51cf\u5f31\u6536\u7f29\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0cLaplacian-LoRA\u6301\u7eed\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5c06GCN\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u591a\u4e24\u500d\u3002\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u5dee\u8bca\u65ad\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u6e90\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6821\u6b63\u662f\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8c31\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

We introduce TwistNet-2D, a lightweight module that computes \\emph{local} pairwise channel products under directional spatial displacement, jointly encoding where features co-occur and how they interact. The core component, Spiral-Twisted Channel Interaction (STCI), shifts one feature map along a prescribed direction before element-wise channel multiplication, thereby capturing the cross-position co-occurrence patterns characteristic of structured and periodic textures. Aggregating four directional heads with learned channel reweighting and injecting the result through a sigmoid-gated residual path, \\TwistNet incurs only 3.5% additional parameters and 2% additional FLOPs over ResNet-18, yet consistently surpasses both parameter-matched and substantially larger baselines -- including ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, and hybrid CNN--Transformer architectures -- across four texture and fine-grained recognition benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TwistNet-2D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6210\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u4e58\u79ef\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u79fb\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7eb9\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u6c60\u5316\u548cGram\u77e9\u9635\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f46\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u6210\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTwistNet-2D\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u87ba\u65cb\u626d\u66f2\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08STCI\uff09\uff1a\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u6cbf\u6307\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u4f4d\u79fb\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u901a\u9053\u5143\u7d20\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u8de8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5171\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u5934\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7sigmoid\u95e8\u63a7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "TwistNet-2D\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0ResNet-18\u76843.5%\u53c2\u6570\u548c2%FLOPs\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u53c2\u6570\u5339\u914d\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ecConvNeXt\u3001Swin Transformer\u548c\u6df7\u5408CNN-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "TwistNet-2D\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6210\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7eb9\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eb9\u7406\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023.

We introduce VertCoHiRF, a fully decentralized framework for vertical federated clustering based on structural consensus across heterogeneous views, allowing each agent to apply a base clustering method adapted to its local feature space in a peer-to-peer manner. Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "VertCoHiRF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ea4\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u540d\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8ek-means\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u6216\u4ea4\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u9002\u5e94\u5176\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u5171\u8bc6\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u540d\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u672c\u5730\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VertCoHiRF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u805a\u7c7b\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Generative models for materials could help, but are currently limited by the lack of high-quality training data. While recent video generative models effortlessly produce realistic material appearances, this knowledge remains entangled with geometry and lighting. We present VideoNeuMat, a two-stage pipeline that extracts reusable neural material assets from video diffusion models. First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a \"virtual gonioreflectometer\" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions.

Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input. Numerical simulations validate our approach, demonstrating stable, high-speed tracking of dynamic references.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u692d\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53cc\u7f06\u60ac\u6302\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7f06\u7ef3\u4ea4\u53c9\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7d22\u7ed3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7f06\u7ef3\u5f20\u529b\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u67b6\u98de\u884c\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u7eb5\u76f8\u4e92\u7f20\u7ed5\u7684\u7f06\u7ef3\u5f62\u6210\u7d22\u7ed3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f06\u7ef3\u8f85\u52a9\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7d22\u7ed3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5305\u88f9\u8f7d\u8377\u6216\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f62\u6210\u7ef3\u7ed3\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f06\u7ef3\u95f4\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u692d\u7403\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u6761\u7f06\u7ef3\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7d22\u7ed3\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u56db\u67b6\u98de\u884c\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u5c04\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CLF-HOCBF-QP\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7f06\u7ef3\u5f20\u529b\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u671f\u671b\u7684\u7d22\u7ed3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\n3. \u5c06\u671f\u671b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u8003\u914d\u7f6e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5bf9\u9636\u4e3a1\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u692d\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548cCLF-HOCBF-QP\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e3a\u7f06\u7ef3\u8f85\u52a9\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e2d\u7684\u7f06\u7ef3\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d22\u7ed3\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002"}}

While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "XVWM\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf93D\u73af\u5883\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u5982\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff09\u89c4\u5212\u4f1a\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08XVWM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5e27\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u540e\u540c\u4e00\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Aimlabs\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5f55\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u60f3\u8c61\u6d41\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u9002\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ece\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u6267\u884c\u3002\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eba\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u52a8\u540e\u679c\u3002"}}

This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

A closely related but distinct problem is training models that are robust to internal perturbations to their weights, which may be an important need for future low-power hardware platforms. In this paper, we explore the usage of two methods, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and random-weight perturbation (RWP), to find minima robust to a variety of random corruptions to weights. We consider the problem from two angles: generalization (how do we reduce the noise-robust generalization gap) and optimization (how do we maximize performance from optimizers when subject to strong perturbations). First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP. Lastly, we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength to match the evolution of the loss landscape improves optimizing for these perturbed objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7SAM\u548cRWP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316RWP\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u6700\u4f18\uff0cSAM\u5728\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4f46\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff09\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316(SAM)\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8(RWP)\u3002\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316RWP\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790SAM\u5728\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316RWP\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u6700\u4f18\uff1bSAM\u5728\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55RWP\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7531\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cdSAM\u548cRWP\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6270\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790SAM\u548cRWP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316RWP\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u6700\u4f18\uff0cSAM\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4f46\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Our method provides pixel-level annotations for lesions, which practically supports Ophthalmologist to screen DR from fundus images.

To enhance lesion segmentation, an attention mechanism was integrated with DeepLab-V3+. Compared to the baseline model, the Attention-DeepLab model increases mean average precision (mAP) from 0.3010 to 0.3326 and the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.1791 to 0.1928.

Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u53cc\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u7b49\u77ac\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5730\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u5165\u5143\u7d20\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u529e\u516c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing robust alignment methods focus on uncertainty in alignment data, while overlooking optimization-induced fragility in preference-based objectives. In this work, we revisit robustness for LLM safety alignment from an optimization geometry perspective, and argue that robustness failures cannot be addressed by data-centric methods alone. We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift.

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average.

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively.

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

However, current SAEs are trained per modality, producing dictionaries whose features are not directly understandable and whose explanations do not transfer across domains. In this study, we introduce LUCID (Learning Unified vision-language sparse Codes for Interpretable concept Discovery), a unified vision-language sparse autoencoder that learns a shared latent dictionary for image patch and text token representations, while reserving private capacity for modality-specific details. We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations.

Accepted by ICRA 2026", "summary": "Aerial manipulation (AM) promises to move Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) beyond passive inspection to contact-rich tasks such as grasping, assembly, and in-situ maintenance. Most prior AM demonstrations rely on external motion capture (MoCap) and emphasize position control for coarse interactions, limiting deployability. We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap. The main components are (1) an augmented visual-inertial odometry (VIO) estimator with contact-consistency factors that activate only during interaction, tightening uncertainty around the contact frame and reducing drift, and (2) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to mitigate perception-control coupling, together with a hybrid force-motion controller that regulates contact wrenches and lateral motion for stable contact. Experiments show that our approach closes the perception-to-wrench loop using only onboard sensing, yielding an velocity estimation improvement of 66.01% at contact, reliable target approach, and stable force holding-pointing toward deployable, in-the-wild aerial manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u63a7\u5236\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5-\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ec5\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a5\u89e6\u5e27\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b2) \u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u51cf\u5c11\u611f\u77e5-\u63a7\u5236\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u529b-\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8c03\u8282\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u529b\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8666.01%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u63a5\u8fd1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u671d\u7740\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91ce\u5916\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing steering-based alignment methods suffer from limited controllability: steering a target value often unintentionally activates other, non-target values. To characterize this limitation, we introduce value leakage, a diagnostic notion that captures the unintended activation of non-target values during value steering, along with a normalized leakage metric grounded in Schwartz's value theory. In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining. Experiments show that NeVA achieves stronger target value alignment while incurring smaller performance degradation on general capability. Moreover, NeVA significantly reduces the average leakage, with residual effects largely confined to semantically related value classes. Overall, NeVA offers a more controllable and interpretable mechanism for value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeVA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4ef7\u503c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5728\u5bfc\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u4ef7\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeVA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u610f\u5916\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eSchwartz\u4ef7\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002NeVA\u8bc6\u522b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNeVA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u9020\u6210\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002NeVA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u6b8b\u4f59\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "NeVA\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines.

Under a Spectral Dominance condition, we show certified unlearnability is feasible when the poison spectrum overwhelms the clean semantic spectrum. Guided by this, we propose Unlearnable Tabular Data via DecOuPled Shortcut EmbeddIng (UTOPIA), which exploits feature redundancy to decouple optimization into two channels: high saliency features for semantic obfuscation and low saliency redundant features for embedding a hyper correlated shortcut, yielding constraint-aware dominant shortcuts while preserving tabular validity.

In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

Motivated by discrete physics losses and Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) constructions, we embed finite-element (FEM) computations at nodes and Gauss points directly into message-passing layers and propose a numerically consistent FEM-Informed Hypergraph Neural Networks (FHGNN). Similar to conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), training is purely physics-driven and requires no labeled data: the input is a node element hypergraph whose edges encode mesh connectivity. Guided by empirical results and condition-number analysis, we adopt an efficient variational loss. Validated on 3D benchmarks, including cyclic loading with isotropic/kinematic hardening, the proposed method delivers substantially improved accuracy and efficiency over recent, competitive PINN variants. By leveraging GPU-parallel tensor operations and the discrete representation, it scales effectively to large elastoplastic problems and can be competitive with, or faster than, multi-core FEM implementations at comparable accuracy.

The enhanced images result in areas with large local noise and loss of more details without proper guidance for global information. Attention mechanisms can better focus on and use global information. However, attention to images could significantly increase the number of parameters and computations. We propose a Row-Column Separated Attention module (RCSA) inserted after an improved U-Net. The RCSA module's input is the mean and maximum of the row and column of the feature map, which utilizes global information to guide local information with fewer parameters.

Solving this vast challenge requires scalable coral regeneration technologies that can breed climate-resilient species and accelerate the natural regrowth processes; actions that are impeded by the absence of safe and robust tools to handle the fragile coral. We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReefFlex\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8f6f\u624b\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u6293\u53d6\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u73ca\u745a\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u6062\u590d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5165\u4fb5\u7269\u79cd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u6b63\u5728\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u7834\u574f\u5168\u7403\u73ca\u745a\u7901\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6e14\u4e1a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6d77\u5cb8\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u73ca\u745a\u518d\u751f\u6280\u672f\u6765\u57f9\u80b2\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u578b\u7269\u79cd\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u7136\u518d\u751f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u5904\u7406\u8106\u5f31\u73ca\u745a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReefFlex\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8f6f\u624b\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u6293\u53d6\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u624b\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u6293\u53d6\u73ca\u745a\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "ReefFlex\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u6293\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u73ca\u745a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u6062\u590d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9646\u4e0a\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "ReefFlex\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u73ca\u745a\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u5148\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u6062\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Shum"], "title": "Benchmarking Autonomous Vehicles: A Driver Foundation Model Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize global transportation systems. However, its widespread acceptance and market penetration remain significantly below expectations. This gap is primarily driven by persistent challenges in safety, comfort, commuting efficiency and energy economy when compared to the performance of experienced human drivers. We hypothesize that these challenges can be addressed through the development of a driver foundation model (DFM). Accordingly, we propose a framework for establishing DFMs to comprehensively benchmark AVs. Specifically, we describe a large-scale dataset collection strategy for training a DFM, discuss the core functionalities such a model should possess, and explore potential technical solutions to realize these functionalities. We further present the utility of the DFM across the operational spectrum, from defining human-centric safety envelopes to establishing benchmarks for energy economy.

In particular, a concept of feature unlearning, in which a neural network progressively loses previously learned features over long training, has gained attention. In this study, we consider the infinite-width limit of a two-layer neural network updated with a large-batch stochastic gradient, then derive differential equations with different time scales, revealing the mechanism and conditions for feature unlearning to occur. Specifically, we utilize the fast-slow dynamics: while an alignment of first-layer weights develops rapidly, the second-layer weights develop slowly. The direction of a flow on a critical manifold, determined by the slow dynamics, decides whether feature unlearning occurs. We give numerical validation of the result, and derive theoretical grounding and scaling laws of the feature unlearning. Our results yield the following insights: (i) the strength of the primary nonlinear term in data induces the feature unlearning, and (ii) an initial scale of the second-layer weights mitigates the feature unlearning.

However, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets providing both ECG images and their corresponding ground truth signals with comprehensive annotations. We introduce PTB-XL-Image-17K, a complete synthetic ECG image dataset comprising 17,271 high-quality 12-lead ECG images generated from the PTB-XL signal database. Our dataset uniquely provides five complementary data types per sample: (1) realistic ECG images with authentic grid patterns and annotations (50% with visible grid, 50% without), (2) pixel-level segmentation masks, (3) ground truth time-series signals, (4) bounding box annotations in YOLO format for both lead regions and lead name labels, and (5) comprehensive metadata including visual parameters and patient information. We present an open-source Python framework enabling customizable dataset generation with controllable parameters including paper speed (25/50 mm/s), voltage scale (5/10 mm/mV), sampling rate (500 Hz), grid appearance (4 colors), and waveform characteristics. The dataset achieves 100% generation success rate with an average processing time of 1.35 seconds per sample. PTB-XL-Image-17K addresses critical gaps in ECG digitization research by providing the first large-scale resource supporting the complete pipeline: lead detection, waveform segmentation, and signal extraction with full ground truth for rigorous evaluation.

Jin Kim"], "title": "Personalized Autonomous Driving via Optimal Control with Clearance Constraints from Questionnaires", "comment": null, "summary": "Driving without considering the preferred separation distance from surrounding vehicles may cause discomfort for users. To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario.

Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks.

This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower.

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide an attractive substrate for such specialization, yet existing FPGA-based neural approaches are fragmented and difficult to compare. We present BitLogic, a fully gradient-based, end-to-end trainable framework for FPGA-native neural networks built around Lookup Table (LUT) computation. BitLogic replaces multiply-accumulate operations with differentiable LUT nodes that map directly to FPGA primitives, enabling native binary computation, sparse connectivity, and efficient hardware realization. The framework offers a modular functional API supporting diverse architectures, along with learned encoders, hardware-aware heads, and multiple boundary-consistent LUT relaxations. An automated Register Transfer Level (RTL) export pipeline translates trained PyTorch models into synthesizable HDL, ensuring equivalence between software and hardware inference.

Existing evaluators frequently struggle with a critical perception gap we term \"Attention Collapse,\" where models neglect cross-image comparisons and fail to capture fine-grained details, resulting in inaccurate perception and miscalibrated scores. To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench. Furthermore, SpatialReward serves as a robust signal in online RL, boosting OmniGen2 by +0.90 on GEdit-Bench--surpassing the leading discriminative model and doubling the gain of GPT-4.1 (+0.45).

While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\\times$--$1073\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking.

We propose the first BO algorithm that achieves no-regret guarantee in a general reward setting, requiring only Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and accommodating a broad class of measurement noise. The core of our approach is a novel surrogate model, termed as infinite Gaussian process ($\\infty$-GP). It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution. Furthermore, with a truncated Gibbs sampling procedure, our method is computationally scalable, incurring minimal additional memory and computational complexities compared to classical GP. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in settings with non-stationary, heavy-tailed, or other ill-conditioned rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u9650\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u221e-GP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u7279\u6027\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9650\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u221e-GP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u65ad\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u75c5\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u221e-GP\u7ed3\u5408\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The effectiveness of these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models depends on the quality and accessibility of publicly available datasets, which provide the basis for training and analyzing classification algorithms. Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability.

Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors.

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChiDeK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u6027\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6838\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u5fc3\u624b\u6027\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u624b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u6027\u662f\u5206\u5b50\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u8bb0\u6216\u6709\u9650\u76843D\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u624b\u6027\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChiDeK\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u6027\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6838\u7f16\u7801SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u624b\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u624b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5706\u4e8c\u8272\u8c31\u548c\u65cb\u5149\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1aR/S\u6784\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5bf9\u6620\u4f53\u6392\u5e8f\u3001ECD\u5149\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u65cb\u5149\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc77%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ChiDeK\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u7acb\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u5fc3\u624b\u6027\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u624b\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Project page:https://bimanibench.github.io/", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BiManiBench\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u8d77\u91cd\u9505\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u6311\u6218\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBiManiBench\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u9ad8\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4f4e\u5c42\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e13\u95e8\u9694\u79bb\u53cc\u81c2\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u624b\u81c2\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u533a\u5206\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "result": "\u5bf930\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u719f\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8303\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u53cc\u81c2\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.\n  Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets. This yields a new model selection procedure for bandits that may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9759\u6001\u9057\u61be\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e24\u79cd\u9057\u61be\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4e2a\u9057\u61be\u57fa\u51c6\u65f6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u4e2d\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u9057\u61be\uff08\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u56fa\u5b9a\u81c2\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\uff08\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u5e8f\u5217\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u5404\u81ea\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e24\u79cd\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8fb9\u754c\u3002Marinov\u548cZimmert[2021]\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06Marinov\u548cZimmert[2021]\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u635f\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8d1f\u9759\u6001\u9057\u61be\u6765\u8865\u507f\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u65f6\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9Blackwell\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u6765\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u79cd\u9057\u61be\u3002\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u6700\u4f18\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e24\u79cd\u9057\u61be\u6700\u4f18\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4e2a\u9057\u61be\u57fa\u51c6\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u624b\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u9057\u61be\u57fa\u51c6\u65f6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u9057\u61be\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a brain-image alignment strategy that leverages multiple pre-trained visual encoders with distinct inductive biases to capture hierarchical and multi-scale visual representations, while employing a contrastive learning objective to achieve effective alignment between brain signals and visual embeddings.

We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear.

However, a theoretical understanding of why sign-based updates outperform variance-adapted methods remains elusive. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails.

Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel implicit motion representation that compresses per-frame motion into compact 1D motion tokens. This design relaxes strict spatial constraints inherent in 2D representations and effectively prevents identity information leakage from the motion video. Furthermore, we design a temporally consistent mask token-based retargeting module that enforces a temporal training bottleneck, mitigating interference from the source images' motion and improving retargeting consistency. Our methodology employs a three-stage training strategy to enhance the training efficiency and ensure high fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our implicit motion representation and the propose IM-Animation's generative capabilities are achieve superior or competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5IM-Animation\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u5e27\u8fd0\u52a8\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u76841D\u8fd0\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u9aa8\u67b6\u3001DWPose\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u9690\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u5c42\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u5e27\u8fd0\u52a8\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u76841D\u8fd0\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u74f6\u9888\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u548cIM-Animation\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b57\u7b26\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8-\u5916\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric B\u00e9zier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency.

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, existing methods for bimanual manipulation often rely on costly data collection and training, struggling to generalize to unseen objects in novel categories efficiently. In this paper, we present Bi-Adapt, a novel framework designed for efficient generalization for bimanual manipulation via semantic correspondence. Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

This strategy not only reduces labeling expenses but also results in energy savings during neural network training, thereby enhancing both data and energy efficiency. In this paper, we implement and evaluate various state-of-the-art acquisition functions, analyzing their accuracy and computational costs, while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network. This trade-off is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration. Our aggregated acquisition functions alleviate common AL pathologies such as batch mode inefficiency and the cold start problem. Additionally, we focus on balancing accuracy and energy consumption, contributing to the development of more sustainable, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluate our proposed structures on various models and datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of these structures to reduce computational costs while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Innovative aggregation approaches, such as alternating between acquisition functions such as BALD and BADGE, have shown robust results.

However, existing systems often face limitations in both accuracy and the ability to recognize small targets. In this study, we propose a bionic stabilized localization system based on CA-YOLO, designed to enhance both target localization accuracy and small target recognition capabilities. Acting as the \"brain\" of the system, the target detection algorithm emulates the visual focusing mechanism of animals by integrating bionic modules into the YOLO backbone network. These modules include the introduction of a small target detection head and the development of a Characteristic Fusion Attention Mechanism (CFAM). Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), a bionic pan-tilt tracking control strategy is developed, which incorporates central positioning, stability optimization, adaptive control coefficient adjustment, and an intelligent recapture function. The experimental results show that CA-YOLO outperforms the original model on standard datasets (COCO and VisDrone), with average accuracy metrics improved by 3.94%and 4.90%, respectively.Further time-sensitive target localization experiments validate the effectiveness and practicality of this bionic stabilized localization system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eCA-YOLO\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4eff\u751f\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u5ead\u773c\u53cd\u5c04\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e91\u53f0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faCA-YOLO\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728YOLO\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4eff\u751f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236(CFAM)\uff1b2) \u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u524d\u5ead\u773c\u53cd\u5c04\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4eff\u751f\u4e91\u53f0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u91cd\u6355\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "CA-YOLO\u5728COCO\u548cVisDrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53473.94%\u548c4.90%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms.

However, OCL models are often not evaluated regarding these goals. Instead, most prior work focuses on evaluating OCL models solely through object discovery and simple reasoning tasks, such as probing the representation via image classification. We identify two limitations in existing benchmarks: (1) They provide limited insights on the representation usefulness of OCL models, and (2) localization and representation usefulness are assessed using disjoint metrics. To address (1), we use instruction-tuned VLMs as evaluators, enabling scalable benchmarking across diverse VQA datasets to measure how well VLMs leverage OCL representations for complex reasoning tasks. To address (2), we introduce a unified evaluation task and metric that jointly assess localization (where) and representation usefulness (what), thereby eliminating inconsistencies introduced by disjoint evaluation.

This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u548c\u7275\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u53d8\u7eb5\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u9879\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6052\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u77ac\u6001\u6062\u590d", "motivation": "\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fa7\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u504f\u822a\u77ac\u53d8\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u4f7f\u8f66\u8f86\u504f\u79bb\u9884\u671f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6052\u5b9a\u7eb5\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u77ac\u6001\u9636\u6bb5\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u8f68Ackermann\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u548c\u7275\u5f15\u529b\u3002\u516c\u5f0f\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u6a2a\u5411-\u504f\u822a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u7eb5\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5e38\u88ab\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u8026\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u9879", "result": "\u5728MATLAB\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u8f68\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u51c63\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5355\u8f68\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u521d\u59cb\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u77ac\u6001\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6052\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u78b0\u649e\u6062\u590d\u573a\u666f"}}

We study the feature sensitivity problem, which asks whether an ensemble is sensitive to a specified subset of features -- such as protected attributes -- whose manipulation can alter model predictions. Existing approaches often yield examples of sensitivity that lie far from the training distribution, limiting their interpretability and practical value. We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles. Third, we introduce a data-aware framework generating realistic examples close to the training distribution. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on large tree ensembles, demonstrating scalability to ensembles with up to 800 trees of depth 8, achieving substantial improvements over the state of the art. This framework provides a practical foundation for analyzing the reliability and fairness of tree-based models in high-stakes applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\u5982\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u654f\u611f\u793a\u4f8b\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f31\u70b9\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u5f80\u5f80\u8fdc\u79bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6a21\u7406\u8bba\uff08SMT\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MILP\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u6811\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u654f\u611f\u793a\u4f8b\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684NP\u96be\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3a1\u7684\u6811\u4ecd\u4e3aNP\u96be\uff09\uff1bMILP\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5355\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230800\u68f5\u6df1\u5ea68\u7684\u6811\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f31\u70b9\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for classifying cat breeds using a subset of the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which contains high-resolution images of various domestic breeds. We employed the Global Context Vision Transformer (GCViT) architecture-tiny for cat breed recognition. To improve model generalization, we used extensive data augmentation, including rotation, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustment. Experimental results show that the GCViT-Tiny model achieved a test accuracy of 92.00% and validation accuracy of 94.54%.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u633d\u6551\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u633d\u6551\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u5352\u4e2d\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u5f81\u7ec4\u7ec7\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5165\u9662\u65f6(T1)\u4eceCT\u704c\u6ce8\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3001\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784(mJ-Net\u548cnnU-Net)\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u52fe\u753bT1\u548c\u968f\u8bbfT2\u7684\u63a9\u819c\u5e76\u76f8\u4ea4\u6784\u5efa\u516d\u4e2aROI\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7ec4\u7ec7\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u5728T1\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u968f\u8bbfDWI\u4e0eCTP\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u540d\u6210\u529f\u518d\u704c\u6ce8\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u5448\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b2) \u521d\u59cb\u4e3a\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u6216\u5065\u5eb7\u6700\u7ec8\u6062\u590d\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u7ec8\u6897\u6b7b\u533a\u57df\u5f62\u6210\u660e\u663e\u5206\u7ec4\uff1b3) \u57fa\u7ebfGLCM\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u5747\u663e\u793a\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u968f\u6700\u7ec8\u72b6\u6001\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u800c\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u65e0\u6b64\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b4) \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4(mJ-Net\u5c24\u5176\u660e\u663e)\u80fd\u5f3a\u6548\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u633d\u6551\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u633d\u6551\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u5206\u79bb\u6307\u6570\u663e\u8457\u975e\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u884d\u751f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8868\u578b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u5352\u4e2d\u6f14\u53d8\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u633d\u6551\u6027\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\u6216\u7f29\u653e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4f4d\u59ff\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u573a\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u548c\u79bb\u8f74\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u4ecd\u9891\u7e41\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u9760\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6267\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\u6216\u7f29\u653e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eUR5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u573a\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6267\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is particularly harmful in modern applications such as learning-enhanced platform operations and post-bandit statistical inference. Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \\cdot S_T=\u03a9(T^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $\u0398(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= \u03c9(\\sqrt{T})$.

However, global alignment is easily dominated by non-diagnostic information, while local alignment fails to integrate key diagnostic evidence. As a result, learning reliable diagnostic representations becomes difficult, which limits their applicability in medical scenarios with limited paired data. To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGDEA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u5f0f\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u975e\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5(LGDEA)\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ece\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bc1\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u975e\u914d\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u8bed\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "LGDEA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u636e\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Transformers, as powerful foundational models, have been applied to scRNA-seq clustering. Their self-attention mechanism automatically assigns higher attention weights to cells within the same cluster, enhancing the distinction between clusters. Existing methods for scRNA-seq clustering, such as graph transformer-based models, treat each cell as a token in a sequence. Their computational and space complexities are $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with respect to the number of cells, limiting their applicability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.To address this challenge, we propose a Bipartite Graph Transformer-based clustering model (BGFormer) for scRNA-seq data. We introduce a set of learnable anchor tokens as shared reference points to represent the entire dataset.

Slot attention is a popular approach that represents individual objects as latent vectors, called slots. Current methods obtain these slot representations solely from the last layer of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), ignoring valuable, semantically rich information encoded across the other layers. To better utilize this latent semantic information, we introduce MUFASA, a lightweight plug-and-play framework for slot attention-based approaches to unsupervised object segmentation. Our model computes slot attention across multiple feature layers of the ViT encoder, fully leveraging their semantic richness. We propose a fusion strategy to aggregate slots obtained on multiple layers into a unified object-centric representation. Integrating MUFASA into existing OCL methods improves their segmentation results across multiple datasets, setting a new state of the art while simultaneously improving training convergence with only minor inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "MUFASA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8eslot attention\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eslot attention\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ViT\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5c42\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u8fdb\u884cslot attention\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMUFASA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97slot attention\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u83b7\u5f97\u7684slot\u805a\u5408\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5c06MUFASA\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709OCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8f7b\u5fae\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MUFASA\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eslot attention\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniPlan\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u62d3\u6251\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u5230PDDL\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLM\u548cLLM+PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\uff08\u5982UniDomain\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u684c\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u95e8\u7a7f\u8d8a\u548c\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u8c03\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "UniPlan\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u4eceUniDomain\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u684c\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\u57df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u95e8\u7a7f\u8d8a\u548c\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u8c03\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5e26\u6709\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u5730\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u5c06\u951a\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176PDDL\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u63a5\u5730\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u56fe\uff08\u540c\u6837\u7528PDDL\u8868\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684PDDL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cUniPlan\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u8ba1\u5212\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eVLM\u548cLLM+PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UniPlan\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u684c\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The aim of this work is to form a comprehensive understanding of groundwater salinization underlying causal factors and identify important meteorological, geological and anthropogenic drivers of salinity. We have integrated different datasets of potential covariates, to create a robust framework for machine learning based predictive models including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolution neural network (CNN) and linear regression (LR), of groundwater salinity. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) followed by Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Explainable AI (XAI) based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to estimate the importance scores and find insights into the drivers of salinization. We also did causality analysis via Double machine learning using various predictive models. From these analyses, key meteorological (Precipitation, Temperature), geological (Distance from river, Distance to saline body, TWI, Shoreline distance), and anthropogenic (Area of agriculture field, Treated Wastewater) covariates are identified to be influential drivers of groundwater salinity across Israel. XAI analysis also identified Treated Wastewater (TWW) as an essential anthropogenic driver of salinity, its significance being context-dependent but critical in vulnerable hydro-climatic environment.

This study investigates the intrinsic few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) capabilities of frozen DINOv3 features through a training-free baseline, FSSDINO, utilizing class-specific prototypes and Gram-matrix refinement. Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation. Crucially, we conduct an Oracle-guided layer analysis, identifying a significant performance gap between the standard last-layer features and globally optimal intermediate representations. We reveal a \"Safest vs. Optimal\" dilemma: while the Oracle proves higher performance is attainable, matching the results of compute-intensive adaptation methods, current unsupervised and support-guided selection metrics consistently yield lower performance than the last-layer baseline. This characterizes a \"Semantic Selection Gap\" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state.

F. Tan"], "title": "ODELoRA: Training Low-Rank Adaptation by Solving Ordinary Differential Equations", "comment": "38 pages", "summary": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning method in deep transfer learning, due to its reduced number of trainable parameters and lower memory requirements enabled by Burer-Monteiro factorization on adaptation matrices. However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faODELoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4ODE\u4f18\u5316LoRA\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5b8c\u6574\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4f4e\u79e9\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u5f00\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u90fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eODE\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff08ODELoRA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u5b8c\u6574\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6b27\u62c9\u548cRunge-Kutta\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "ODELoRA\u4e3aLoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eODE\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

However, existing training-free methods often rely on rigid visual feature injection, creating a conflict between identity fidelity and textual adaptability. To address this, we propose FlexID, a novel training-free framework utilizing intent-aware modulation. FlexID orthogonally decouples identity into two dimensions: a Semantic Identity Projector (SIP) that injects high-level priors into the language space, and a Visual Feature Anchor (VFA) that ensures structural fidelity within the latent space. Crucially, we introduce a Context-Aware Adaptive Gating (CAG) mechanism that dynamically modulates the weights of these streams based on editing intent and diffusion timesteps. By automatically relaxing rigid visual constraints when strong editing intent is detected, CAG achieves synergy between identity preservation and semantic variation. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that FlexID achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity consistency and text adherence, offering an efficient solution for complex narrative generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexID\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexID\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u8eab\u4efd\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u5148\u9a8c\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u951a\u70b9\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41", "result": "\u5728IBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlexID\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "FlexID\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u89e3\u8026\u8eab\u4efd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u534f\u540c"}}

Existing methods either (i) use end-to-end trained models with vision-language embeddings, which struggle to generalize beyond training data and lack action-level explainability, or (ii) rely on modular zero-shot pipelines with large language models (LLMs) and open-set object detectors, which suffer from error propagation, high computational cost, and difficulty integrating their reasoning back into the navigation policy. To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer \"Is this the target object?\" and \"Why should I take this action?\" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: \"think\", \"think summary\", and \"action\", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning.

Maximal Update Parametrization ($\u03bc$P) helps explain why many hyperparameters transfer across width. Yet depth scaling is less understood for modern architectures, whose computation graphs contain multiple parallel paths and residual aggregation. To unify various non-recurrent multi-path neural networks such as CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers, we introduce a graph-based notion of effective depth. Under stabilizing initializations and a maximal-update criterion, we show that the optimal learning rate decays with effective depth following a universal -3/2 power law. Here, the maximal-update criterion maximizes the typical one-step representation change at initialization without causing instability, and effective depth is the minimal path length from input to output, counting layers and residual additions.

However, these models remain limited to single-condition inputs and lack the flexibility needed to synthesize results from multiple heterogeneous sources. We present SIGMA (Selective-Interleaved Generation with Multi-Attribute Tokens), a unified post-training framework that enables interleaved multi-condition generation within diffusion transformers. SIGMA introduces selective multi-attribute tokens, including style, content, subject, and identity tokens, which allow the model to interpret and compose multiple visual conditions in an interleaved text-image sequence. Through post-training on the Bagel unified backbone with 700K interleaved examples, SIGMA supports compositional editing, selective attribute transfer, and fine-grained multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments show that SIGMA improves controllability, cross-condition consistency, and visual quality across diverse editing and generation tasks, with substantial gains over Bagel on compositional tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIGMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eBagel\u7edf\u4e00\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u591a\u5c5e\u6027token\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u9519\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5982Bagel\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u6e90\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "SIGMA\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u591a\u5c5e\u6027token\uff08\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea4\u9519\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Bagel\u7edf\u4e00\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c70\u4e07\u4ea4\u9519\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSIGMA\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4Bagel\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SIGMA\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u591a\u5c5e\u6027token\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ea4\u9519\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

When demonstrations originate from multiple experts with different intentions, the problem is known as Multi-Intention IRL (MI-IRL). Recent deep generative MI-IRL approaches couple behavior clustering and reward learning, but typically require prior knowledge of the number of true behavioral modes $K^*$. This reliance on expert knowledge limits their adaptability to new behaviors, and only enables analysis related to the learned rewards, and not across the behavior modes used to train them. We propose Contrastive Multi-Intention IRL (CoMI-IRL), a transformer-based unsupervised framework that decouples behavior representation and clustering from downstream reward learning.

Gait recognition provides a practical alternative, as it can be captured reliably at a distance. To promote progress in gait recognition and provide a fair evaluation platform, the International Competition on Human Identification at a Distance (HID) has been organized annually since 2020. Since 2023, the competition has adopted the challenging SUSTech-Competition dataset, which features substantial variations in clothing, carried objects, and view angles. No dedicated training data are provided, requiring participants to train their models using external datasets. Each year, the competition applies a different random seed to generate distinct evaluation splits, which reduces the risk of overfitting and supports a fair assessment of cross-domain generalization.

We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \\textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \\textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \\textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \\textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \\textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \\textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \\textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process.

This paper introduces the Pavlovian Associative Learning Models Simulator (PALMS), a Python environment to simulate Pavlovian conditioning experiments. In addition to the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model, PALMS incorporates several attentional learning approaches, including Pearce-Kaye-Hall, Mackintosh Extended, Le Pelley's Hybrid, and a novel extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model with a unified variable learning rate that integrates Mackintosh's and Pearce and Hall's opposing conceptualisations. The simulator's graphical interface allows for the input of entire experimental designs in an alphanumeric format, akin to that used by experimental neuroscientists. Moreover, it uniquely enables the simulation of experiments involving hundreds of stimuli, as well as the computation of configural cues and configural-cue compounds across all models, thereby considerably expanding their predictive capabilities. PALMS operates efficiently, providing instant visualisation of results, supporting rapid, precise comparisons of various models' predictions within a single architecture and environment. Furthermore, graphic displays can be easily saved, and simulated data can be exported to spreadsheets. To illustrate the simulator's capabilities and functionalities, we provide a detailed description of the software and examples of use, reproducing published experiments in the associative learning literature.

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%).

During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances.

We present MammoColor, an end-to-end framework with a Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding (TDCE) module that converts single-channel mammograms into TDCE-encoded views for visual augmentation. Materials and Methods:MammoColor couples a lightweight TDCE module with a BI-RADS triage classifier and was trained end-to-end on VinDr-Mammo. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set, two public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast), and three external clinical cohorts. We also conducted a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) observer study with a washout period, comparing (1) grayscale-only, (2) TDCE-only, and (3) side-by-side grayscale+TDCE. Results:On VinDr-Mammo, MammoColor improved AUC from 0.7669 to 0.8461 (P=0.004). Gains were larger in dense breasts (AUC 0.749 to 0.835). In the MRMC study, TDCE-encoded images improved specificity (0.90 to 0.96; P=0.052) with comparable sensitivity.

Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to \"Intent Cloning\" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a \"virtual equilibrium point\", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%.

In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

We introduce \"graph-based conformal compression\", a framework for constructing compact subgraphs that preserve statistical validity while reducing structural complexity. We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees. Our results on the one hand bridge efficient conformal prediction with combinatorial graph compression via monotonicity, to provide rigorous guarantees on both statistical validity, and compression or size. On the other hand, they also highlight an algorithmic regime, distinct from classical densest-$k$-subgraph hardness settings, where the problem can be approximated efficiently.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data.

This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs.

Yet, understanding how this behavior emerges on natural data is challenging because retrieval and memorization are entangled. To disentangle the two, we introduce Gaussian Match-and-Copy (GMC), a minimalist benchmark that isolates long-range retrieval through pure second-order correlation signals. Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection.

One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u5378\u8f7d\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u63a5\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u5378\u8f7d\u6269\u5c55\u672c\u5730\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u653b\u51fb\u6216\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684SOA\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u5378\u8f7d\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u529f\u80fd\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u635f\u574f\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u8282\u7701\u662f\u529f\u80fd\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u52a8\u673a\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u5230SOFOF\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u5378\u8f7d\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models. This makes our method both efficient and scalable compared to conventional NN-based ensemble approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4fc3\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u6210\u5458\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684TSC\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u4e92\u8865\u800c\u975e\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCR\u6863\u6848\u7684128\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u9f13\u52b1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u6210\u5458\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/StevenHH2000/fine-r1", "summary": "Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Based on the energy-shaping framework and under the standard assumption of passive interactions with the human and the environment, the controllers ensure that the position error and velocities globally converge to zero in the absence of time delays. In this case, the closed-loop system admits a homogeneous approximation of negative degree, and thus the control objective is achieved in finite-time. The proposed controllers are simple, continuous-time proportional-plus-damping-injection schemes, validated through both simulation and experimental results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6b27\u62c9-\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cc\u8fb9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u7a77\u65f6\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u6574\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5728\u65e0\u65f6\u5ef6\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u5230\u96f6\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u8d1f\u5ea6\u9f50\u6b21\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7a77\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6b27\u62c9-\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u8fb9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7a77\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u6574\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5747\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u52a0\u963b\u5c3c\u6ce8\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u8d1f\u5ea6\u9f50\u6b21\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5728\u65e0\u65f6\u5ef6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u5230\u96f6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7a77\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u7a77\u65f6\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6b27\u62c9-\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u8fb9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address this, a surge of deep generative models has recently emerged to learn dynamics at coarsened timesteps for efficient trajectory generation, yet they either generalize poorly across systems or, due to limited molecular diversity of trajectory data, fail to fully exploit structural information to improve generative fidelity. Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses. Experiments on proteins and protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that PVB faithfully reproduces thermodynamic and kinetic observables from MD while delivering stable and efficient generative dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PVB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6865\u63a5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u6865\u63a5\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u6784\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u56e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u5206\u6865\u63a5(PVB)\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6865\u63a5\u5339\u914d\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u5355\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u914d\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f34\u968f\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548c\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPVB\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u590d\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "PVB\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1.

However, these are rarely available for high-dimensional mechanical systems such as deformable objects or soft robots. While neural architectures can learn to approximate complex dynamics, they are either limited to low-dimensional systems or provide only limited formal control guarantees due to a lack of embedded physical structure. This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics.

While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models.

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

A critical component of this interaction is Interactive Visual Grounding (IVG), through which robots must interpret human intentions and resolve ambiguity. Existing IVG models generally lack a mechanism to determine when to ask clarification questions, as they implicitly rely on their learned representations. CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens. We train on a real-world interactive dataset for IVG, and a mixed ambiguity set for the detector. With InViG-only supervision, our model surpasses a state-of-the-art method while using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Similarly, the ambiguity detector outperforms prior baselines.

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Astro\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u5185\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6291\u5236\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bf9LLM\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u8981\u4e48\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u7e41\u91cd\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7b97\u5b50\u878d\u5408\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316LLM\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAstro\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5185\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5e45\u5ea6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u96f6\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u4e0eGPTQ\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA-2-7B\u4e0a\uff0cAstro\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6781\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6bd4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u7684\u7ea61/3\u3002", "conclusion": "Astro\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To provide a rigorous and objective assessment, we curate the UMD dataset comprising 490 whole-body PET/CT and 464 whole-body PET/MRI scans ($\\sim$675k 2D images, $\\sim$12k 3D organ annotations) and conduct a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of representative 3D segmentation foundation models. Through intra-subject controlled comparisons of paired scans, we isolate imaging modality as the primary independent variable to evaluate model robustness in real-world applications. Our evaluation reveals a stark discrepancy between literature-reported benchmarks and real-world efficacy, particularly when transitioning from structural to functional domains. Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility.

Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations.

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Otsu\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9002\u7528\uff0cJaccard\u6307\u6570\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u626b\u63cf\u521b\u5efa\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SLA\u6280\u672f\u6253\u5370\u7403\u4f53\u3001\u9762\u7f69\u548cAAA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7micro-CT\u626b\u63cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528GMM\u3001Otsu\u548cRG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528KU\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Dice\u3001Jaccard\u7b49\u4f53\u7d20\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528ICP\u914d\u51c6\u8868\u9762\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u8868\u9762\u6307\u6807", "result": "Otsu\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u6700\u9002\u7528\uff1bAAA\u56e0\u58c1\u8584\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u53e0\u5f97\u5206\u4f4e\uff1b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9AAA\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff1b\u8868\u9762\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4f53\u7d20\u6307\u6807\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u540c\uff1bRG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7403\u4f53\u6700\u597d\uff0cGMM\u548cOtsu\u5bf9AAA\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u9762\u7f69\u8868\u9762\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0ICP\u914d\u51c6\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u603b\u548c\uff1b\u9ad8\u4f53\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u654f\u611f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\uff1bJaccard\u6307\u6570\u6bd4Dice\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5fc5\u987b\u786e\u4fdd\u4f53\u7d20\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u624d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b"}}

A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced.

This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity.

In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts.

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\\rightarrow$ urban and day $\\rightarrow$ night ($\\sim 31\\%$ each); actor swaps $\\sim 10\\%$, moderate rain $\\sim 7\\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance.

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7528\u4f8b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5371\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eWaymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5371\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff1b2. \u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Waymo Open Dataset\uff1b3. \u5728doScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5371\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9053\u8def\u5371\u9669\uff1b\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u8868\u793a-\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u6f5c\u529b\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u3002"}}

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $\u03c7_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $\u03c7_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $\u03c7_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $\u03c0_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs.

We propose Process-of-Thought (PoT) Reasoning for Videos, a framework that makes the reasoning process explicit by structuring video inference into a sequence of lightweight, verifiable steps. PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools.

While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TwinRL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f-\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5f15\u5bfcVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728VLA\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTwinRL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6355\u6349\u7684\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b2\uff09\u5728SFT\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e76\u884c\u5728\u7ebfRL\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u91c7\u6837\u8bc6\u522b\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u4f46\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "TwinRL\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6f14\u793a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u533a\u57df\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u901f30%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea620\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f-\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This task is particularly challenging due to the highly unstructured environment: coal and gangue are randomly piled, backgrounds are complex and variable, and foreign objects often exhibit low contrast, deformation, occlusion, resulting in coupling with their surroundings. These characteristics weaken the stability and regularity assumptions that many anomaly detection methods rely on in structured industrial settings, leading to notable performance degradation. To support evaluation and comparison in this setting, we construct \\textbf{CoalAD}, a benchmark for unsupervised foreign-object anomaly detection with pixel-level localization in coal-stream scenes. We further propose a complementary-cue collaborative perception framework that extracts and fuses complementary anomaly evidence from three perspectives: object-level semantic composition modeling, semantic-attribution-based global deviation analysis, and fine-grained texture matching.

We propose U-KABS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates the expressive power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture to enhance segmentation performance. The U-KABS model combines the convolutional and squeeze-and-excitation stage, which enhances channel-wise feature representations, and the KAN Bernstein Spline (KABS) stage, which employs learnable activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials and B-splines. This hybrid design leverages the global smoothness of Bernstein polynomials and the local adaptability of B-splines, enabling the model to effectively capture both broad contextual trends and fine-grained patterns critical for delineating complex structures in medical images. Skip connections between encoder and decoder layers support effective multi-scale feature fusion and preserve spatial details.

Preprint. Code: https://github.com/jbarnes850/test-time-training", "summary": "Test-time training (TTT) adapts language models through gradient-based updates at inference. But is adaptation the right strategy? We study compute-optimal test-time strategies for verifiable execution-grounded (VEG) tasks, domains like GPU kernel optimization where a deterministic evaluator provides dense, continuous reward signals. Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation.

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset.

Existing methods often fail to address distribution shift across clients and distribution drift over time, or they rely on unrealistic assumptions such as known number of client clusters and data heterogeneity types, which limits their generalizability. We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes. However, when the Rashomon set - the set of near-optimal models - is large, standard counterfactual explanations can become unreliable, as a recourse action valid for one model may fail under another. We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines.

Project page: https://rolling-sink.github.io/", "summary": "Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

This tension is exposed by spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) parameterizations, where grid refinement can induce parameter growth and brittle optimization in high dimensions. To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization. SGN augments a standard activation pathway with a compact spectral pathway and learnable gates that allow the model to start from a stable base behavior and progressively allocate capacity to spectral features during training. The spectral pathway is instantiated with trainable Random Fourier Features (learned frequencies and phases), replacing grid-based splines and removing resolution dependence. A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PCN\uff09\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff08BP\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14PC\u80fd\u91cf\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u4e8eBP\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\uff08PC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff08BP\uff09\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5408\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PCN\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5df2\u901a\u8fc7BP\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76PCN\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u6790PC\u4e0eBP\u5728\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\uff0cPC\u4e0eBP\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPC\u80fd\u91cf\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u4e8eBP\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u540c\u6837\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5404\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3aPCN\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPC\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eBP\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations.

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u636e\u7f51\u683c\u5730\u56fe\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5360\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6355\u6349\u7f51\u683c\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5360\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u5360\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u969c\u788d\u7269\u548c\u906e\u6321\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cWoven Planet\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u4ed6\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u4f53\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

While effective for individual prediction problems, this paradigm underutilizes the rich structure of clinical data and limits the transferability, stability, and interpretability of learned features. In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines.

While numerous deepfake detection methods have been proposed, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate fine-tuned models, leaving a critical gap in understanding out-of-the-box performance -- the most common deployment scenario for practitioners. We present the first comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art detection methods, comprising 23 pretrained detector variants (due to multiple released versions of certain detectors), across 12 diverse datasets, comprising 2.6~million image samples spanning 291 unique generators including modern diffusion models. Our systematic analysis reveals striking findings: (1)~no universal winner exists, with detector rankings exhibiting substantial instability (Spearman~$\u03c1$: 0.01 -- 0.87 across dataset pairs); (2)~a 37~percentage-point performance gap separates the best detector (75.0\\% mean accuracy) from the worst (37.5\\%); (3)~training data alignment critically impacts generalization, causing up to 20--60\\% performance variance within architecturally identical detector families; (4)~modern commercial generators (Flux~Dev, Firefly~v4, Midjourney~v7) defeat most detectors, achieving only 18--30\\% average accuracy; and (5)~we identify three systematic failure patterns affecting cross-dataset generalization. Statistical analysis confirms significant performance differences between detectors (Friedman test: $\u03c7^2$=121.01, $p<10^{-16}$, Kendall~$W$=0.524).

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "ForecastOcc\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8fc7\u53bb\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u72ec\u7f51\u7edc\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u8fc7\u53bb\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForecastOcc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u30012D\u52303D\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u30013D\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u5934\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u672a\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728SemanticKITTI\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u5355\u76ee\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002ForecastOcc\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u5177\u6709\u672a\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "ForecastOcc\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faExplanation-Generalization Score (EGS)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30GNN\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEGS\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u56fe\u7684GNN\u5e76\u5728OOD\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c06OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u679c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0811,200\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff0cEGS\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u6355\u6349\u56e0\u679c\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6392\u5e8f", "conclusion": "EGS\u4e3aGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Only MiVOLO, which uniquely combines face and body features via Vision Transformers, competes with VLMs. We further analyze age verification at the 18-year threshold, revealing that non-LLM models exhibit 60--100\\% false adult rates on minors while VLMs achieve 13--25\\%, and demonstrate that coarse age binning (8--9 classes) consistently degrades MAE beyond 13 years.

These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific architectures are necessary for age estimation and suggest that the field should redirect toward distilling VLM capabilities into efficient specialized models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLMs\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u90e8\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8634\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0822\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u548c12\u4e2a\u901a\u7528VLMs\uff09\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u603b\u8ba11,100\u5f20\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLMs\u5e73\u5747MAE\u4e3a5.65\u5e74\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\u76849.88\u5e74\uff1b\u6700\u4f73VLM\uff08Gemini 3 Flash Preview\uff0cMAE 4.32\uff09\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff08MiVOLO\uff0cMAE 5.10\uff09\u4f1815%\uff1b\u572818\u5c81\u9608\u503c\u5e74\u9f84\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0cVLMs\u7684\u8bef\u5224\u7387\uff0813-25%\uff09\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0860-100%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u5c06VLM\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ee7\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1\u72ec\u7acb\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPicasso\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u975e\u7a7f\u900f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u7a7f\u900f\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPicasso\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u8651\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u975e\u7a7f\u900f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684Picasso\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cYCB-V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPicasso\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e2\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u53c8\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u6574\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1bPicasso\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5bf9LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5171\u4eab\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7279\u5b9a\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Chinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528AdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Muon\u3001Shampoo\u3001SOAP\uff09\u867d\u7136\u627f\u8bfa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1) \u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5355\u72ec\u62df\u5408Chinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5b58\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eChinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u662f\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "1) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5355\u72ec\u62df\u5408\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1b3) \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u662f\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u6307\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3aChinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Most diffusion-based reconstructions are formulated around Gaussian-noise corruption and rely on additional consistency steps to incorporate SMS physics, which can be mismatched to the operator-governed degradations in SMS acquisition. We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion. Experiments on fastMRI brain data and prospectively acquired in vivo diffusion MRI data demonstrate improved fidelity and reduced slice leakage over conventional and learning-based SMS reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u540c\u65f6\u591a\u5c42\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u5207\u7247\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u540c\u65f6\u591a\u5c42\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f\u7684MRI\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5c42\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7f3a\u5931k\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u6574\u5408SMS\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eSMS\u91c7\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u9000\u5316\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u91c7\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5efa\u6a21\u9000\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u53cd\u8f6c\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u6761\u4ef6\u53cc\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u76ee\u6807\u5207\u7247\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9000\u5316\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884cSMS\u5c42\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728fastMRI\u8111\u6570\u636e\u548c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u4f53\u5185\u6269\u6563MRI\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SMS\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5c42\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u548cOCDI-Net\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406SMS\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5c42\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5c11\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information.

We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

Recently, zero-shot diffusion based methods have been proposed for such inverse problems, offering a posterior sampling based solution that leverages prior knowledge. Such algorithms incorporate the observations through inference, often leaning on manual tuning and heuristics. In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7406\u60f3\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8c31\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u957f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565"}}

However, each paradigm suffers from inherent limitations when operating in isolation: OVAD is restricted to coarse category-level semantics, while RSVG is structurally limited to single-target localization. These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding.

Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability.

Prior work has mainly focused on perceptual hallucinations, leaving reasoning level unfaithfulness underexplored. To isolate faithfulness from linguistic priors, we introduce SPD-Faith Bench, a diagnostic benchmark based on fine-grained image difference reasoning that enforces explicit visual comparison. Evaluations on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal two systematic failure modes, perceptual blindness and perception-reasoning dissociation. We trace these failures to decaying visual attention and representation shifts in the residual stream.

Surprisingly Strong and Sparse Reinforcement Learning with SGD in LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0SGD\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eAdamW\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u4e3aRL\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ecd\u6cbf\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684AdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4f46RL\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14AdamW\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684RL\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790AdamW\u5728RL\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bf9RL\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1SGD\u5728RL\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eAdamW\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "SGD\u5728LLM\u7684RL\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eAdamW\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6781\u5176\u7a00\u758f\uff08<0.02%\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4AdamW\u5c111000\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSGD\u662f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684RL\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0cRL\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We introduce \\textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \\textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency.

Project page: https://maxmilite.github.io/rec-from-ultrafast-blur/", "summary": "We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020). Our results thus reveal an inherent connection between adaptive data analysis and privacy beyond differential privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u7a20\u5bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(log T)\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6b21\u4f18\u7684O(\u221aT)\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(log T)\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u7a20\u5bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(log T)\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81-\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u8c13\u8bcd\u5355\u6311\"(PSO)\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u9690\u79c1\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86O(log T)\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6ee1\u8db3PSO\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u9690\u79c1\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We introduce SSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark for spatial reasoning on constrained manifolds, built from complex real-world 3D structures whose feasible configurations are tightly governed by geometric, topological, and physical constraints. SSI-Bench contains 1,000 ranking questions spanning geometric and topological reasoning and requiring a diverse repertoire of compositional spatial operations, such as mental rotation, cross-sectional inference, occlusion reasoning, and force-path reasoning. It is created via a fully human-centered pipeline: ten researchers spent over 400 hours curating images, annotating structural components, and designing questions to minimize pixel-level cues. Evaluating 31 widely used VLMs reveals a large gap to humans: the best open-source model achieves 22.2% accuracy and the strongest closed-source model reaches 33.6%, while humans score 91.6%. Encouraging models to think yields only marginal gains, and error analysis points to failures in structural grounding and constraint-consistent 3D reasoning.

Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_\u03b2$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\\sim$20\\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery.

Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, these methods require tens to hundreds of neural network evaluations at inference time, which can become a computational bottleneck in large-scale scientific sampling workflows. We introduce Riemannian MeanFlow~(RMF), a framework for learning flow maps directly on manifolds, enabling high-quality generations with as few as one forward pass. We derive three equivalent characterizations of the manifold average velocity (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and semigroup identities), and analyze parameterizations and stabilization techniques to improve training on high-dimensional manifolds.

By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability.

Although a single preference-conditioned policy is the most flexible and scalable solution, existing approaches remain brittle in practice, frequently failing to recover complete Pareto fronts. We show that this failure stems from two structural issues in current methods: destructive gradient interference caused by premature scalarization and representational collapse across the preference space. We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "D\u00b3PO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8fc7\u65e9\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u504f\u597d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "D\u00b3PO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fdd\u7559\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5f3a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6MORL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cD\u00b3PO\u59cb\u7ec8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "D\u00b3PO\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We present a zero-shot evaluation of open-source VLMs for privacy-related attribute recognition. We identify the attributes for which VLMs exhibit strong inter-annotator agreement, and discuss the disagreement cases of human and VLM annotations. Our results show that when evaluated against human annotations, VLMs tend to predict the presence of privacy attributes more often than human annotators. In addition to this, we find that in cases of high inter-annotator agreement between VLMs, they can complement human annotation by identifying attributes overlooked by human annotators. This highlights the potential of VLMs to support privacy annotations in large-scale image datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9057\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3VLMs\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bVLMs\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eVLM\u6807\u6ce8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "1.

We propose MaD-Mix, a principled and computationally efficient framework that derives multi-modal data mixtures for VLM training. MaD-Mix formulates data mixing as modality-aware domain alignment maximization and obtains closed-form multi-modal alignment scores from the Fenchel dual through inter-modal coupling variables. MaD-Mix systematically handles domains with missing modalities, allowing for the integration of language-only domains. Empirical evaluations across 0.5B and 7B models demonstrate that MaD-Mix accelerates VLM training across diverse benchmarks. MaD-Mix matches human-tuned data mixtures using 22% fewer training steps in image-text instruction tuning. In complex tri-modal video-image-text scenarios, where manual tuning becomes impractical, MaD-Mix boosts average accuracy over uniform weights, with negligible mixture computation overhead (< 1 GPU-hour), enabling scalable mixture design for modern VLM pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaD-Mix\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u52a0\u901fVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u3001\u89c6\u9891-\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316VLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaD-Mix\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8d39\u6b47\u5c14\u5bf9\u5076\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8026\u5408\u53d8\u91cf\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u57df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u57df\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u57280.5B\u548c7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aMaD-Mix\u80fd\u52a0\u901fVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u5c11\u752822%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u89c6\u9891-\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff08<1 GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MaD-Mix\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3VLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art performance in tabular anomaly detection has been achieved by converting tabular data into text and fine-tuning LLMs. However, these methods randomly order columns during conversion, without considering the causal relationships between them, which is crucial for accurately detecting anomalies. In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect. Experiments across more than 30 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

To improve the generalization of the model, we regard different surveillance scenes as different category scenes, and introduce few-shot learning to make the model adapt to the unseen surveillance scene that belongs to the given exemplar category scene. To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way. Experiments on three surveillance datasets shows that proposed method can adapt to the unseen surveillance scene and outperform recent state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot crowd counting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8de8\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u63a7\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u573a\u666f\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5c5e\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8303\u4f8b\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u89c1\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u5c40\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u591a\u539f\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c40\u90e8\u65b9\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We introduce D-ORCA, a \\textbf{d}ialogue-centric \\textbf{o}mni-modal large language model optimized for \\textbf{r}obust audio-visual \\textbf{ca}ptioning. We further curate DVD, a large-scale, high-quality bilingual dataset comprising nearly 40,000 multi-party dialogue videos for training and 2000 videos for evaluation in English and Mandarin, addressing a critical gap in the open-source ecosystem. To ensure fine-grained captioning accuracy, we adopt group relative policy optimization with three novel reward functions that assess speaker attribution accuracy, global speech content accuracy, and sentence-level temporal boundary alignment. These rewards are derived from evaluation metrics widely used in speech processing and, to our knowledge, are applied for the first time as reinforcement learning objectives for audio-visual captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ORCA substantially outperforms existing open-source models in speaker identification, speech recognition, and temporal grounding. Notably, despite having only 8 billion parameters, D-ORCA achieves performance competitive with Qwen3-Omni across several general-purpose audio-visual understanding benchmarks.

We study the approximation of matrix functions, which map scalar functions to matrices, using neural networks including transformers. We focus on functions mapping square matrices to square matrices of the same dimension. These types of matrix functions appear throughout scientific computing, e.g., the matrix exponential in continuous-time Markov chains and the matrix sign function in stability analysis of dynamical systems. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we prove bounds on the width and depth of ReLU networks needed to approximate the matrix exponential to an arbitrary precision. Second, we show experimentally that a transformer encoder-decoder with suitable numerical encodings can approximate certain matrix functions at a relative error of 5% with high probability. Our study reveals that the encoding scheme strongly affects performance, with different schemes working better for different functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5305\u62ecTransformer\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5177\u6709\u5408\u9002\u6570\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u7684Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u4ee55%\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u67d0\u4e9b\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u3001\u77e9\u9635\u7b26\u53f7\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u8bc1\u660eReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\uff1b2. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7279\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff1b2. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5408\u9002\u6570\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u7684Transformer\u80fd\u4ee5\u7ea65%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u67d0\u4e9b\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u51fd\u6570\u9002\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5305\u62ecTransformer\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u5f71\u54cdTransformer\u5728\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7f16\u7801\u3002"}}

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry.

The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work?

However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration.

In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems.

Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction.

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against cutting-edge synthesis methods. Our findings highlight a concerning trend: many state-of-the-art detection models exhibit markedly poor performance when challenged with deepfakes produced by modern synthesis techniques, including poor performance by human participants against the best quality deepfakes.

Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARTI-MARS2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5929\u82b1\u677f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARTI-MARS2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565MARTI-MARS2-T+\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u768432B\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMARTI-MARS2\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8677.7%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86GPT-5.1\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff1a\u4ece\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5230\u540c\u8d28\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u518d\u5230\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684RL\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684TTS\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MARTI-MARS2\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems.

However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement.

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions.

Existing methods rely on training-time strategies that do not generalise to unseen constraints during inference, and struggle to handle conditional tasks beyond tabular imputation. While manifold theory offers a principled way to guide generation, current formulations are tied to specific inference-time objectives and are limited to continuous domains. We extend manifold theory to tabular data and expand its scope to handle diverse inference-time objectives. On this foundation, we introduce HARPOON, a tabular diffusion method that guides unconstrained samples along the manifold geometry to satisfy diverse tabular conditions at inference. We validate our theoretical contributions empirically on tasks such as imputation and enforcing inequality constraints, demonstrating HARPOON'S strong performance across diverse datasets and the practical benefits of manifold-aware guidance for tabular data.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

Classical models are interpretable but restrictive, while deep learning models are flexible but often non-interpretable and sensitive to noise. We propose GRAFT (Gated Residual Accelerated Failure Time), a novel AFT model that decouples prognostic ranking from calibration. GRAFT's hybrid architecture combines a linear AFT model with a non-linear residual neural network, and it also integrates stochastic gates for automatic, end-to-end feature selection. The model is trained by directly optimizing a differentiable, C-index-aligned ranking loss using stochastic conditional imputation from local Kaplan-Meier estimators.

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

Existing anti-exploration methods count continuous state-action pairs by discretizing these data, but often suffer from the issues of dimension disaster and information loss in the discretization process, leading to efficiency and performance reduction, and even failure of policy learning. In this paper, a novel anti-exploration method based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and fuzzy clustering in offline RL is proposed. We first propose an efficient pseudo-count method based on the multi-codebook VQVAE to discretize state-action pairs, and design an offline RL anti-exploitation method based on the proposed pseudo-count method to handle the dimension disaster issue and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a codebook update mechanism based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is developed to improve the use rate of vectors in codebooks, addressing the information loss issue in the discretization process.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data. However, they often struggle to capture complex and diverse data distributions, particularly in scenarios involving incomplete inputs or significant missing regions. These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines. For instance, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct under SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO, OGPSA preserves strong safety while recovering general capability, improving SimpleQA from 0.53\\% to 3.03\\% and IFEval from 51.94\\% to 63.96\\%.

Existing adaptive portfolio methods often base their decisions on past function values while ignoring richer information like remaining budget or surrogate model characteristics. To address this, we introduce LMABO, a novel framework that casts a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot, online strategist for the BO process. At each iteration, LMABO uses a structured state representation to prompt the LLM to select the most suitable acquisition function from a diverse portfolio. In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines. We show that the LLM's behavior is a comprehensive strategy that adapts to real-time progress, proving its advantage stems from its ability to process and synthesize the complete optimization state into an effective, adaptive policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LMABO\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5e08\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u572850\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u505a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u7b49\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLMABO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5e08\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u793aLLM\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cLMABO\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fdb\u5c55\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5168\u9762\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark.

However, its widespread adoption is hindered by a reliance on untestable causal assumptions and by the lack of robustness-oriented evaluation in existing benchmarks. To address these challenges, we propose CausalCompass, a flexible and extensible benchmark suite designed to assess the robustness of time-series causal discovery (TSCD) methods under violations of modeling assumptions. To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization. Finally, our work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of TSCD methods under assumption violations, thereby facilitating their broader adoption in real-world applications.

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry.", "AI": {"tldr": "DICE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u98ce\u683c\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u53d8\u5f97\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7248\u6743\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u7b56\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDICE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u975e\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u89e3\u7f20\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u683c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9QKV\u5411\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5dee\u5f02\u6291\u5236\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "DICE\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u5f7b\u5e95\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u4ec5\u9700\u989d\u59163\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\u7f20\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e3a\u904f\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "DICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u7aef\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples.

Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity.

Traditional machine learning (ML) models, though widely applied to PD detection, often rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture complex feature interactions. This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data. We present a comparative evaluation of four classification models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, TabNet, and SAINT, using a benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of biomedical voice measurements from PD patients and healthy controls.\n  Experimental results show that SAINT consistently outperformed all baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving a weighted precision of 0.98, weighted recall of 0.97, weighted F1-score of 0.97, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9990, and the highest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores. The superior performance of SAINT is attributed to its dual attention mechanism, which effectively models feature interactions within and across samples.\n  These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of attention-based deep learning architectures for early Parkinson's disease detection and highlight the importance of dynamic feature representation in clinical prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAINT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eMLP\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548cTabNet\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528UCI\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a(MLP)\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3001TabNet\u548cSAINT\u3002SAINT\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "SAINT\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u52a0\u6743\u7cbe\u786e\u73870.98\u3001\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u73870.97\u3001\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u65700.97\u3001\u9a6c\u4fee\u65af\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u65700.9990\u3001\u6700\u9ad8AUC-ROC\u3002TabNet\u548cMLP\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8bca\u65ad\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002SAINT\u7684\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit, which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time learning.\n  In this work (Part~II), we study the consequences of this irreversibility for continual learning from a trajectory-level perspective. We show that finite dissipation constrains not only which solutions are reachable, but which learning paths remain dynamically accessible.\n  Although a continuum of task-equivalent realizations can achieve identical task performance, finite-time learning irreversibly selects among these realizations. This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \\emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget.\n  As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5fc5\u7136\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u5173\u952e\u671f\u5173\u95ed\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u7eed\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u5982\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\"\u5173\u952e\u671f\u5173\u95ed\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e94\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8017\u6563\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fMLLMs\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MLLM\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5df2\u7f16\u7801\u5927\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u7684MLLM\u5934\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7b80\u77ed\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff09\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eMLLMs\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fr\u00e9chet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\uff08ALE\u66f2\u7ebf\uff09\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\"\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\"\u548c\"\u5982\u4f55\"\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5c40\u90e8\u6548\u5e94\uff08ALE\uff09\u66f2\u7ebf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u8f83ALE\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u6743\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u548c\u975e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eALE\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

MMLSv2 consists of multimodal imagery with seven bands: RGB, digital elevation model, slope, thermal inertia, and grayscale channels. MMLSv2 comprises 664 images distributed across training, validation, and test splits. In addition, an isolated test set of 276 images from a geographically disjoint region from the base dataset is released to evaluate spatial generalization. Experiments conducted with multiple segmentation models show that the dataset supports stable training and achieves competitive performance, while still posing challenges in fragmented, elongated, and small-scale landslide regions. Evaluation on the isolated test set leads to a noticeable performance drop, indicating increased difficulty and highlighting its value for assessing model robustness and generalization beyond standard in-distribution settings.

Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Across 16 benchmarks over complex neurosymbolic tasks, we demonstrate that CLIPPER boosts the performance of state-of-the-art neurosymbolic engines like Scallop, Dolphin, and ISED by up to 48%, 53%, and 8%, leading to state-of-the-art accuracies.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIPPER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u526a\u679d\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u7b7e\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f1a\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLIPPER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\"\u76f8\u4f3c\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ef\u80fd\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\"\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u526a\u679d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c0a\u91cd\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCLIPPER\u5c06Scallop\u3001Dolphin\u548cISED\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe48%\u300153%\u548c8%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIPPER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC).", "AI": {"tldr": "MTF \u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7f6e\u6362\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5df2\u5b66\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5931\u6548\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5ea6\u91cf-\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u89e3\uff08MTF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5e94\u5ea6\u91cf\u6536\u7f29\uff08\u9ece\u66fc\u7ed3\u6784\u53d7\u63a7\u53d8\u5f62\uff09\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5219\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5e76\u5355\u72ec\u5b58\u50a8\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u62d3\u6251Urysohn\u673a\uff08TUM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u644a\u9500\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\uff08MAMI\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0MTF\u3002", "result": "MTF\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5207\u6362\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982EWC\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u5bfc\u822a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ff7\u5bab\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u91cd\u5851\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee5\u4f7f\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\u6210\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002MTF\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MambaFusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a763D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u548c\u7a97\u53e3\u5316Transformer\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001token\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u95e8\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5934\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eBEV\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff1b2\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d3D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u548c\u7a97\u53e3\u5316Transformer\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001token\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08MTA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u95e8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u6807\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u76f8\u673a\u548cLiDAR\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5934\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u566a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SSM-based\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR. We also analyze how such an advantage naturally arises in different problems. On the negative side, when the structural advantage is not present, RLVR may converge to suboptimal compositions.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines.

We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget.

In this work, we propose DAS-SK, a novel lightweight architecture that retrofits selective kernel convolution (SK-Conv) into the dual atrous separable convolution (DAS-Conv) module to strengthen multi-scale feature learning. The model further enhances the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, enabling the capture of fine-grained local structures alongside global contextual information. Built upon a modified DeepLabV3 framework with two complementary backbones - MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNet-B3, the DAS-SK model mitigates limitations associated with large dataset requirements, limited spectral generalization, and the high computational cost that typically restricts deployment on UAVs and other edge devices. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks: LandCover.ai, VDD, and PhenoBench, demonstrate that DAS-SK consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, while being more efficient than CNN-, transformer-, and hybrid-based competitors. Notably, DAS-SK requires up to 21x fewer parameters and 19x fewer GFLOPs than top-performing transformer models.

Orthogonally, projection-based low-rank optimizers were mainly designed for memory efficiency, but remain suboptimal for communication-limited training: one-sided synchronization still transmits an $O(rn)$ object for an $m\\times n$ matrix gradient and refresh steps can dominate peak communicated bytes. We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

While current approaches address them separately, we introduce a unifying probability-space framework that subsumes both as limit cases, and enables reward-guided flow merging, allowing principled, task-aware combination of multiple pre-trained flows (e.g., merging priors while maximizing drug-discovery utilities). Our formulation renders possible to express a rich family of operators over generative models densities, including intersection (e.g., to enforce safety), union (e.g., to compose diverse models), interpolation (e.g., for discovery), their reward-guided counterparts, as well as complex logical expressions via generative circuits. Next, we introduce Reward-Guided Flow Merging (RFM), a mirror-descent scheme that reduces reward-guided flow merging to a sequence of standard fine-tuning problems. Then, we provide first-of-their-kind theoretical guarantees for reward-guided and pure flow merging via RFM.

Under peer review", "summary": "Estimating Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, qualitative analysis reveals that the generation trajectories of our model exhibit distinct behaviors in cases characterized by high noise or significant physiological variability, thereby offering a novel layer of interpretability for AI-aided diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5c04\u8840\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5MCSDR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5c04\u8840\u5206\u6570\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u75c5\u6001\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u89d2\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u5f53\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u91cd\u5c3e\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\uff08\u5e38\u89c1\u4e8e\u75c5\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08MCSDR\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u7684LVEF\u8fde\u7eed\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728EchoNet-Dynamic\u3001EchoNet-Pediatric\u548cCAMUS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMCSDR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u663e\u8457\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MCSDR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406LVEF\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas. This survey seeks to fill these gaps. In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is currently the most comprehensive review in the field of MoE.

However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based\" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics.

Intriguingly, this continuous-time lens is not forced; it appears natural--and perhaps necessary: the discrete-time problem seems to be asking for a continuous-time solution, and we know of no other way to obtain a sharp ES bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u91c7\u6837\uff08ES\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027bandit\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u96c6\u6210\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3am=\u0398(d log n)\u65f6\uff0cES\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eThompson\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u5f53\u7684regret\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027bandit\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5176\u4e0eThompson\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3am\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u9f50\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2", "result": "\u5f53\u96c6\u6210\u89c4\u6a21m=\u0398(d log n)\u65f6\uff0cES\u8fbe\u5230$\\tilde O(d^{3/2}\\sqrt n)$\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387regret\u754c\uff0c\u4e0eThompson\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5339\u914d", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230Thompson\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\u4f3c\u4e4e\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3"}}

In this paper, we analyse the effect of various techniques for providing additional visual and textual context via tool use to the MLLM and its effect on the REC task. Furthermore, we propose a training-free framework named Chain-of-Caption to improve the REC performance of MLLMs. We perform experiments on RefCOCO/RefCOCOg/RefCOCO+ and Ref-L4 datasets and show that individual textual or visual context can improve the REC performance without any fine-tuning.

Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection.

A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems.

MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search.

However, current methods often depend on replay-based strategies, which raise concerns like memory limits and privacy issues, while also struggling to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this paper, we suggest that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively guide the reasoning process of a fixed GNN backbone. Based on this idea, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM). The key component of TAAM is its lightweight Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs). For each new task, a dedicated NSM is trained and then frozen, acting as an \"expert module.\" These modules perform detailed, node-attentive adaptive modulation on the computational flow of a shared GNN backbone. This setup ensures that new knowledge is kept within compact, task-specific modules, naturally preventing catastrophic forgetting without using any data replay. Additionally, to address the important challenge of unknown task IDs in real-world scenarios, we propose and theoretically prove a novel method named Anchored Multi-hop Propagation (AMP).

Project page: https://adaptive-visual-tts.github.io/", "summary": "Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAVIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u591a\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u60f3\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u89c6\u89d2\u60f3\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u60f3\u8c61\u3001\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5c11\u60f3\u8c61\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u60f3\u8c61\u53cd\u800c\u6709\u5bb3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4e0d\u52a0\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAVIC\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u662f\u5426\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u60f3\u8c61\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5c11\u60f3\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08SAT\u3001MMSI\uff09\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\uff08R2R\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAVIC\u80fd\u591f\u660e\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u5173\u952e\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u56fa\u5b9a\u60f3\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002AVIC\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Standard reinitialization methods, which reinitialize weights toward their original values, are widely used but difficult to tune: conservative reinitializations fail to restore plasticity, while aggressive ones erase useful knowledge. We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN).

However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting.

In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \\textbf{$\\sim$1000$\\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PA\u548cPO\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5206\u533a\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1aPA\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u7a00\u7f3a\u6602\u8d35\uff0cPO\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u4f46\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728PA\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6df7\u5408PO\u548cPA\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u56e0PO\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u7684PO\u6570\u636e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9065\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2. \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1aSwin Transformer Base\u5904\u7406\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\uff0cTabM\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTemporal Swin Transformer\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5806\u53e0\u5f0f\u4e32\u884c\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u6309\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728GeoLifeCLEF 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PA\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u660e\u663e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5408PA\u548cPO\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5730\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment. CASE injects cross-modal semantic guidance into selected spatio-temporal positions, leveraging high-level semantic cues to further alleviate misalignment. In addition, we design lightweight objectives, caption-to-modality InfoNCE, visual-audio consistency, and entropy regularization to guide token selection and strengthen cross-modal semantic alignment.

To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling.

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147.

Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths. The cost model predicts when speculative sampling and heterogeneous execution are jointly beneficial and is validated on an edge device featuring a hexacore Cortex-A CPU and a Mali GPU, revealing up to 1.68$\\times$ speedup for translation tasks, closely matching analytic expectations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.68\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u867d\u7136\u662f\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06SD\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3SoC\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5178\u578b\u7684\u77ed\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6267\u884c\u4f55\u65f6\u8054\u5408\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u914d\u5907\u516d\u6838Cortex-A CPU\u548cMali GPU\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad81.68\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u9884\u671f\u5bc6\u5207\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Building on UGData, we propose UGE, a two-stage training strategy that progressively and stably aligns images, text, and spatial structures by combining instruction-guided contrastive learning with graph-based spatial encoding. We finally introduce UGBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate how spatially grounded embeddings support diverse urban understanding tasks -- including geolocation ranking, image retrieval, urban perception, and spatial grounding. We develop UGE on multiple state-of-the-art VLM backbones, including Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-3-Vision, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral, and train fixed-dimensional spatial embeddings with LoRA tuning. UGE built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone achieves up to 44% improvement in image retrieval and 30% in geolocation ranking on training cities, and over 30% and 22% gains respectively on held-out cities, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit spatial grounding for spatially intensive urban tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UGData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001UGE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548cUGBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u4e0e\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7406\u89e3\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165UGData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faUGE\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u8c03\u4f18\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u7684UGE\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u57ce\u5e02\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d2244%\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6392\u540d30%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u57ce\u5e02\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc730%\u548c22%\u7684\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57ce\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\uff08\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57ce\u5e02\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features.

(2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and establish crucial foundations for advancing PRMs in LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\"\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u7ef4\"\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRMs\uff09\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,206\u6761\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e867\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3aPRMs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\"\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u7ef4\"\u8303\u5f0f\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRMs\uff09\u6765\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u8d1f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709PRMs\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548cPRMs\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e867\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1,206\u6761\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\"\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u7ef4\"\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d64\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u548c16\u4e2a\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b3. \u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524dLVLMs\u4f5c\u4e3aPRMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dLVLMs\u4f5c\u4e3aPRMs\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a1. \u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1b2. \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b3. \u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff1b4. \u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdbLVLMs\u4e2d\u7684PRMs\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\"\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u7ef4\"\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2dPRMs\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765PRMs\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this paper, we devise a novel algorithmic and theoretical framework to approximate an unknown probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}$ from a finite set of samples by an approximate discrete distribution $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while bounding the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. Our framework leverages optimal transport, nonlinear optimization, and concentration inequalities. In particular, we show that, even if $\\mathbb{P}$ is unknown, the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ can be efficiently bounded with high confidence by solving a tractable optimization problem (a mixed integer linear program) of a size that only depends on the size of the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. This enables us to develop intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally find the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while minimizing the Wasserstein distance error.

In this work, we first propose a \\textbf{multi-modal information density assessment framework} to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds)}, which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop \\textbf{E-VAds-R1}, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called \\textbf{MG-GRPO}. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision.

Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

However, challenges persist in handling geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, particularly in complex scenes. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations: (1) difficulty in achieving accurate geometric editing of object translation, rotation, and scaling; (2) inadequate modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects, leading to unrealistic results. To address these issues, we propose GeoEdit, a framework that leverages in-context generation through a diffusion transformer module, which integrates geometric transformations for precise object edits. Moreover, we introduce Effects-Sensitive Attention, which enhances the modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects for improved realism. To further support training, we construct RS-Objects, a large-scale geometric editing dataset containing over 120,000 high-quality image pairs, enabling the model to learn precise geometric editing while generating realistic lighting and shadows.

Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism.

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{D$^2$-VR}, a single-image diffusion-based video-restoration framework with low-step inference. To obtain precise temporal guidance under severe degradation, we first design a Degradation-Robust Flow Alignment (DRFA) module that leverages confidence-aware attention to filter unreliable motion cues.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes.

We propose a training free guardrail based on spectral analysis of attention topology that complements supervised approaches. On Llama 3.1 8B, our method achieves 97.7\\% recall with multi-feature detection and 86.1\\% recall with 81.0\\% precision for balanced deployment, without requiring any labeled training data. Most remarkably, we discover that single layer spectral features act as near-perfect hallucination detectors: Llama L26 Smoothness achieves 98.2\\% recall (213/217 hallucinations caught) with a single threshold, and Mistral L3 Entropy achieves 94.7\\% recall. This suggests hallucination is not merely a wrong token but a thermodynamic state change: the model's attention becomes noise when it errs. Through controlled cross-model evaluation on matched domains ($N=1000$, $T=0.3$, same General domain, hallucination rates 20--22\\%), we reveal the ``Loud Liar'' phenomenon: Llama 3.1 8B's failures are spectrally catastrophic and dramatically easier to detect, while Mistral 7B achieves the best discrimination (AUC 0.900).

To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples.

In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline.

Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency.

We cast it as an Information Bottleneck question: what embedding bottleneck dimension is sufficient to compress predictor and predicted views while preserving their mutual information (MI). This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension.

Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences.

Although existing approaches address imbalance through resampling or cost-sensitive learning during training, they require retraining or access to labeled target data when class distributions shift at deployment time, a common occurrence in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection. We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions.

Martin Gillis", "Isaac Xu", "Thomas Trappenberg"], "title": "Variance-Gated Ensembles: An Epistemic-Aware Framework for Uncertainty Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning applications require fast and reliable per-sample uncertainty estimation. A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient. As a result, VGE provides a practical and scalable approach to epistemic-aware uncertainty estimation in ensemble models.

While recent studies have shown that lighting variations can significantly distort food perception by both humans and AI, existing works are often limited to single food categories or controlled settings, and most public food datasets lack explicit illumination annotations.\n  In this work, we investigate illumination-induced domain shift in multi-class food category recognition using two widely adopted datasets, Food-101 and Fruits-360. We demonstrate substantial accuracy degradation under cross-dataset evaluation due to mismatched visual conditions. To address this challenge, we construct synthetic illumination-augmented datasets by systematically varying light temperature and intensity, enabling controlled robustness analysis without additional labels.\n  We further evaluate cross-dataset transfer learning and domain generalization, with a focus on illumination-sensitive target categories such as apple-based classes. Experimental results show that illumination-aware augmentation significantly improves recognition robustness under domain shift while preserving real-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of illumination robustness and provide practical insights for deploying reliable food recognition systems in real-world inspection scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u5149\u7167\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u4f20\u9001\u5e26\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u98df\u7269\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u6570\u516c\u5171\u98df\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Food-101\u548cFruits-360\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u5149\u7167\u8272\u6e29\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u5149\u7167\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u82f9\u679c\u7c7b\u7b49\u5149\u7167\u654f\u611f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5149\u7167\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5149\u7167\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u98df\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u5149\u7167\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to learn it, as effective self-correction behaviors emerge only rarely, making learning signals extremely sparse. To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability.

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fr\u00e9chet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5355\u57df\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Lucchi++\u548cVNC\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08DINOv2\u3001DINOv3\u548cOpenCLIP\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u5934\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff08PCA\u3001Fr\u00e9chet Dinov2\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u90fd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u524d\u666fIoU\uff09\uff0cLoRA\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aEM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cPEFT\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6539\u5584\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u4e2aEM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u57dfEM\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7684PEFT\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8de8\u5f02\u6784EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose GeoFocus, a novel framework comprising two core modules. 1) Critical Local Perceptor, which automatically identifies and emphasizes critical local structure (e.g., angles, parallel lines, comparative distances) through thirteen theory-based perception templates, boosting critical local feature coverage by 61% compared to previous methods. 2) VertexLang, a compact topology formal language, encodes global figures through vertex coordinates and connectivity relations.

However, standard approaches typically rely on activation addition, a geometric operation that inevitably alters the magnitude of hidden representations. This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality.

A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation. These results demonstrate that causal machine learning applications to clinical trials should include policy-level evaluation alongside heterogeneity testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7597\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6e83\u75a1\u6027\u7ed3\u80a0\u708e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u901a\u5e38\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u2014\u2014\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6392\u5217\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668(BLP)\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u8861\u91cf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u884c\u52a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eUNIFI\u7ef4\u6301\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u62df\u5408X-learner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u7ebf\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3001\u7528\u836f\u53f2\u3001\u7b2c8\u5468\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u884d\u751f\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "BLP\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e4c\u53f8\u5974\u5355\u6297vs\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6709\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u7eb3\u5165\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u672a\u6539\u5584\u9884\u671f\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u81c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002\u8bca\u65ad\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793a\u5185\u955c\u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u2014\u2014\u6539\u5584\u672a\u6cbb\u7597\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u7caa\u4fbf\u9499\u536b\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001CRP\uff09\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5e94\u5305\u62ec\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a sparse monocular graph-based SLAM system for thermal imagery that leverages general-purpose learned features -- the SuperPoint detector and LightGlue matcher, trained on large-scale visible-spectrum data to improve cross-domain generalization. To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches. We further incorporate keypoint confidence scores from SuperPoint into a confidence-weighted factor graph to improve estimation robustness. Evaluations on public thermal datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable performance without requiring dataset-specific training or fine-tuning a desired feature detector, given the scarcity of quality thermal data.

While fractional Brownian motion has been widely used as a noise source to capture such memory effects, its incompatibility with It\u00f4 calculus limits its applicability in neural stochastic differential equation~(SDE) frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel class of noise, termed Neural Network-kernel ARMA-type noise~(NA-noise), which is an It\u00f4-process-based alternative capable of capturing both long- and short-memory behaviors. The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property. Based on this noise process, we develop NANSDE-Net, a generative model that extends Neural SDEs by incorporating NA-noise. We prove the theoretical existence and uniqueness of the solution under mild conditions and derive an efficient backpropagation scheme for training. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NANSDE-Net matches or outperforms existing models, including fractional SDE-Net, in reproducing long- and short-memory features of the data, while maintaining computational tractability within the It\u00f4 calculus framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578bNA-noise\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eIt\u00f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86NANSDE-Net\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6570\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eIt\u00f4\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5bb9It\u00f4\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e14\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNA-noise\uff08\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6838ARMA\u578b\u566a\u58f0\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u79ef\u5206\u89e3\u4fdd\u6301\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaNANSDE-Net\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u795e\u7ecfSDE\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNANSDE-Net\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6570SDE-Net\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u518d\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301It\u00f4\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NA-noise\u4e3a\u6355\u6349\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0eIt\u00f4\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0cNANSDE-Net\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly.

Project page: https://konstantinosmitsides.github.io/dreaming-in-code", "summary": "Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an ever-expanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

This is a preprint version. The camera-ready version will be updated soon", "summary": "Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOT-Edit\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082D\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d562D\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c63D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e863D\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGOT-Edit\u5728\u7ebf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840Transformer\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf2D\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGOT-Edit\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u54082D\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u6574\u5408\u5230\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e2d\uff0cGOT-Edit\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf93D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length.

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian.

However, we argue that the dominant Supervised Learning (SL) training paradigm suffers from a fundamental objective mismatch: minimizing imitation loss (e.g., cross-entropy) does not guarantee solution cost minimization. We dissect this mismatch into two deficiencies: Decoder-Blindness (being oblivious to the non-differentiable decoding process) and Cost-Blindness (prioritizing structural imitation over solution quality). We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation.

Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery.

To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC). In the meantime, the Audio Video coding Standard (AVS) Workgroup of China also have launched and completed the development for its first generation point cloud compression standard, namely AVS PCC.

Such methods, while significantly more computationally favorable compared to their numerical counterparts, fail to provide any calibrated notions of uncertainty in their predictions. Current methods approach this deficiency typically with ensembling or Bayesian posterior estimation. However, these approaches either require distributional assumptions that fail to hold in practice or lack practical scalability, limiting their applications in practice. We, therefore, propose a novel application of conformal prediction to produce distribution-free uncertainty quantification over the function spaces mapped by neural operators. We then demonstrate how such prediction regions enable a formal regret characterization if leveraged in downstream robust decision-making tasks. We further demonstrate how such posited robust decision-making tasks can be efficiently solved using an infinite-dimensional generalization of Danskin's Theorem and calculus of variations and empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over more restrictive modeling paradigms, such as Gaussian Processes, across several engineering tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u9057\u61be\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3aPDE\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u6216\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u7684Danskin\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0b\u6e38\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u9057\u61be\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8ePDE\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a first-principles framework for information dynamics, treating the attention mechanism as a physical system governed by the principle of least action rather than as an algorithmic optimization. By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat. Finally, we discuss how rotational symmetry breaking in the attention manifold generates massless Goldstone bosons, providing a field-theoretic perspective on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE).

However, such semantic features often lack low-level information (\\eg, color and texture), leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity, which has emerged as a primary bottleneck in further scaling LDMs. To address this limitation, we propose LV-RAE, a representation autoencoder that augments semantic features with missing low-level information, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction while remaining highly aligned with the semantic distribution. We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality.

To capture both global and local features, a learnable [CLS] class token is typically prepended to the input sequence of patch tokens. Despite their distinct nature, both token types are processed identically throughout the model. In this work, we investigate the friction between global and local feature learning under different pre-training strategies by analyzing the interactions between class and patch tokens. Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy. The proposed modifications introduce only an 8% increase in parameters, with no additional computational overhead. Through comprehensive ablations, we provide insights into which architectural components benefit most from specialization and how our approach generalizes across model scales and learning frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Vision Transformers\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u7c7btoken\u548c\u5c40\u90e8patch token\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u548cQKV\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cdtoken\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Vision Transformers\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684[CLS]\u7c7btoken\u4e0epatch token\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\uff08\u5168\u5c40vs\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7c7btoken\u548cpatch token\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cdtoken\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671fQKV\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u4e24\u79cdtoken\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u4ec5\u589e\u52a08%\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc72 mIoU\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ece\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u79bbVision Transformers\u4e2d\u7c7btoken\u548cpatch token\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u548c\u65e9\u671fQKV\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347patch\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u6dfb\u52a0\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u53ef\u4f7f\u5fae\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\uff08NTK\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86NTK\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136PEFT\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790PEFT\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "1. \u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u4f7f\u5fae\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8eNTK\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5b8c\u5168\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b3. \u7ed9\u51fa\u7531\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u5f15\u8d77\u7684NTK\u8c31\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b4. \u5728LLMs\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1. \u5f53\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u662f\u826f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0cNTK\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2. \u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cdNTK\u7684\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3. \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3aPEFT\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86NTK\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6307\u5bfc\u6539\u8fdbPEFT\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684LLMs\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

However, existing ICRL methods rely on explicit reward signals during pretraining, which limits their applicability when rewards are ambiguous, hard to specify, or costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICPRL\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfICRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6307\u5b9a\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ICPRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u7684RL\uff08I-PRL\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u6b65\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u597d\u7684RL\uff08T-PRL\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u9996\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u504f\u597d\u539f\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51b3\u6597\u8001\u864e\u673a\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICPRL\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\u7684ICRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "ICPRL\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Among various approaches to applying ML techniques to solving PDEs, the data-driven discretization method presents a promising way of accelerating and improving existing PDE solver on structured grids where it predicts the coefficients of quasi-linear stencils for computing values or derivatives of a function at given positions. It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework.

Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRO-Bid\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u8026\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9057\u61be\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u76ee\u6807CPA\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6df7\u53e0\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u76ee\u6807CPA\u7b49\u4e25\u683c\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u6807\u51c6Return-to-Go\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5ffd\u89c6\u6210\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u6df7\u53e0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u594f\uff1b2\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u56de\u5f52\u8feb\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u4eff\u5386\u53f2\u5e73\u5747\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRO-Bid\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u8026\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8868\u793a\uff08CDPR\uff09\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u805a\u7126\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9057\u61be\u4f18\u5316\uff08CRO\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5386\u53f2\u5e73\u5747\u884c\u4e3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7ea6\u675f\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPRO-Bid\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PRO-Bid\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u4e2d\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Such unknown transformations arise widely in machine learning and scientific modeling, where they can significantly distort observations. We take a probabilistic view and model the posterior over transformations as a Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function on data space. To sample from this posterior, we introduce a diffusion process on Lie groups that keeps all updates on-manifold and only requires computations in the associated Lie algebra. Our method, Transformation-Inverting Energy Diffusion (TIED), relies on a new trivialized target-score identity that enables efficient score-based sampling of the transformation posterior. As a key application, we focus on test-time equivariance, where the objective is to improve the robustness of pretrained neural networks to input transformations. Experiments on image homographies and PDE symmetries demonstrate that TIED can restore transformed inputs to the training distribution at test time, showing improved performance over strong canonicalization and sampling baselines.

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments.

In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones.

A common metric for this, inspired by Boolean function analysis, is average sensitivity, which captures a model's robustness to single-token perturbations. We argue that average sensitivity has two key limitations: it lacks a natural generalization to real-valued domains and fails to explain the \"junta-like\" input dependence we empirically observe in modern LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose noise stability as a more comprehensive simplicity metric. Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\\%$ and $75\\%$ respectively.

This paper proposes a novel trust-based incentive mechanism designed to evaluate and reward the quality of contributions in FL systems. By dynamically assessing trust scores based on fac-tors such as data quality, model accuracy, consistency, and contribution fre-quency, the system encourages honest participation and penalizes unreliable or malicious behavior. These trust scores form the basis of an incentive mechanism that rewards high-trust nodes with greater participation opportunities and penal-ties for low-trust participants.

Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\"\u770b\"\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u4f55\u5730\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u5e72\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u4f55\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u5f97\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u63ed\u793aVLM\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4f55\u65f6\u4f55\u5730\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u539f\u672c\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u7f6e\u4e5f\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6cdb\u5316\u7684grokking\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76grokking\uff08\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6cdb\u5316\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u7531\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3grokking\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u7f6e\u5982\u4f55\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230grokking\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230grokking\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0cgrokking\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "grokking\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u7f6e\u9879\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3grokking\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate whether body region detection in volumetric CT and MR images can be achieved in a fully zero-shot manner by using knowledge embedded in large pre-trained foundation models. We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage.

However, they do not work well for deep chains. The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components.

It has wide applications like view synthesis, relighting, and scene editing. In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RotLight\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u7269\u4f53\u6355\u6349\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\u63d0\u53472DGS\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u5149\u7167\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u989c\u8272\u548c\u70d8\u7119\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3", "method": "1.

While prior work on IGL provides efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, those results are confined to single-step settings, restricting their applicability to modern sequential decision-making systems such as multi-turn Large Language Model (LLM) deployments. To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al. [2024a] from the single-step to the multi-step setting, addressing the unique challenges of decoding latent rewards under MDPs. Building on this estimator, we design an Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) algorithm for policy optimization.

Recent methods exploit explicit binary masks to constrain editing, but hard mask boundaries introduce artifacts and reduce editability. To address these issues, we propose FusionEdit, a training-free image editing framework that achieves precise and controllable edits. First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results.

Therefore, it is crucial to design an algorithm that accelerates each individual test. To this end, we propose the Flow Matching-based Conditional Independence Test (FMCIT). The proposed test leverages the high computational efficiency of flow matching and requires the model to be trained only once throughout the entire causal discovery procedure, substantially accelerating causal discovery. According to numerical experiments, FMCIT effectively controls type-I error and maintains high testing power under the alternative hypothesis, even in the presence of high-dimensional conditioning sets. In addition, we further integrate FMCIT into a two-stage guided PC skeleton learning framework, termed GPC-FMCIT, which combines fast screening with guided, budgeted refinement using FMCIT. This design yields explicit bounds on the number of CI queries while maintaining high statistical power.

Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

Existing CoT compression methods often suffer from a critical loss of logical fidelity at high compression ratios, resulting in significant performance degradation. To achieve high-fidelity, fast reasoning, we propose a novel EXTreme-RAtio Chain-of-Thought Compression framework, termed Extra-CoT, which aggressively reduces the token budget while preserving answer accuracy. To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations. An LLM is then fine-tuned on these compressed pairs via a mixed-ratio supervised fine-tuning (SFT), teaching it to follow a spectrum of compression budgets and providing a stable initialization for reinforcement learning (RL).

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead.

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrHS\uff08Pre-hoc Sparsity\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u89c2\u6d4b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u626d\u66f2\u771f\u5b9etoken\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5e76\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952etoken\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u540e\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPre-hoc Sparsity\uff08PrHS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u524d\u9009\u62e9KV\u6761\u76ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u9645-\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e22\u5f03\u8d28\u91cf\uff08dropped mass\uff09\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u4e8b\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u4e8b\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f74\u548c\u5c42\u8f74\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA\u548cMistral\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728GSM8K\u548cCoQA\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6bd4HShare\u9ad83\u500d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5728LongBench\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u9000\u5316\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529bFLOPs\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea615%\uff1b\u5728NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU\u4e0a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u5b50\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f9.9\u500d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad82.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PrHS\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540e\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation.

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks.

Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer.

Most geometry-based eviction methods score keys by cosine similarity to a global centroid, but cosine is scale-invariant and can discard magnitude cues that distinguish semantically salient tokens. We propose ManifoldKV, a training-free scorer that ranks tokens by Euclidean distance to the key centroid, capturing both angular and radial deviations.\n  On the RULER benchmark, ManifoldKV achieves 95.7% accuracy at 4K-16K contexts with 20% compression; matching the best geometric baseline while improving robustness in two regimes where cosine scoring fails.

However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aInstance-Disentangled Attention\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u652f\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5355\u6307\u4ee4\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u9700\u8981\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u8f91\u800c\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e76\u53d1\u7f16\u8f91\u76f8\u4e92\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Instance-Disentangled Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u671f\u95f4\u5f3a\u5236\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7f16\u8f91\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "Instance-Disentangled Attention\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, jointly optimizing both data and model configurations is often deemed intractable, and existing methods focus on either data or model optimization without considering their interaction. We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "JoBS\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u9884\u7b97\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\"\u9e21\u4e0e\u86cb\"\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u6700\u4f73\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u67b6\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJoBS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff08\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u914d\u90e8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u7b97\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\u5b8c\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u5747\u9057\u61be\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "JoBS\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5404\u79cdLLM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "JoBS\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, many recent talking-head generation (THG) methods rely on GPU-centric neural rendering, large training sets, or high-capacity diffusion models, which limits deployment in offline or resource-constrained learning environments. A deterministic and CPU-oriented THG framework is described, termed Symbolic Vedic Computation, that converts speech to a time-aligned phoneme stream, maps phonemes to a compact viseme inventory, and produces smooth viseme trajectories through symbolic coarticulation inspired by Vedic sutra Urdhva Tiryakbhyam. A lightweight 2D renderer performs region-of-interest (ROI) warping and mouth compositing with stabilization to support real-time synthesis on commodity CPUs. Experiments report synchronization accuracy, temporal stability, and identity consistency under CPU-only execution, alongside benchmarking against representative CPU-feasible baselines. Results indicate that acceptable lip-sync quality can be achieved while substantially reducing computational load and latency, supporting practical educational avatars on low-end hardware.

FTRL is important for curved losses and for understanding adaptive optimizers such as Adam, yet existing dynamic regret analyses are less explored for FTRL. To address this, we build on the discounted-to-dynamic reduction and present a modular way to obtain dynamic regret bounds of FTRL-related problems. Specifically, we focus on two representative curved losses: linear regression and logistic regression. Our method not only simplifies existing proofs for the optimal dynamic regret of online linear regression, but also yields new dynamic regret guarantees for online logistic regression. Beyond online convex optimization, we apply the reduction to analyze the Adam optimizers, obtaining optimal convergence rates in stochastic, non-convex, and non-smooth settings. The reduction also enables a more detailed treatment of Adam with two discount parameters $(\u03b2_1,\u03b2_2)$, leading to new results for both clipped and clip-free variants of Adam optimizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8FTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97FTRL\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "FTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f2\u7ebf\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7406\u89e3Adam\u7b49\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u5206\u6790\u5bf9FTRL\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6298\u6263\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u83b7\u5f97FTRL\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u66f2\u7ebf\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ea6\u7b80\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u3001\u975e\u51f8\u3001\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u53cc\u6298\u6263\u53c2\u6570Adam\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u526a\u88c1\u548c\u65e0\u526a\u88c1Adam\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86FTRL\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd8\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6311\u6218", "motivation": "\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u7535\u5f27\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u94c1\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u90e8\u4ef6\u78e8\u635f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7535\u5f27\u77ac\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u77ac\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7535\u5f27\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u745e\u58eb\u8054\u90a6\u94c1\u8def\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u516c\u5f00\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u5408\u6210\u529b\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faMultiDeepSAD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55DeepSAD\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff1b3) \u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4f2a\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5f27\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u94c1\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, many existing weight-only methods rely on heuristic objectives and greedy rounding, thus leading to noticeable degradation under low-bit quantization. In this work, we introduce OJBKQ (Objective-Joint Babai-Klein Quantization with K-Best Sampling), a layer-wise PTQ method that formulates weight quantization as a joint optimization problem over activations and weights. This formulation results in a multiple-right-hand-side box-constrained integer least squares (BILS) problem in each layer, which is NP-hard. For each column of the weight matrix, we apply an extended Babai nearest-plane algorithm and an extended version of Klein's randomized Babai algorithm to find the minimum-residual Babai-Klein point, a sub-optimal solution to the BILS problem.

Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLBF\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u56de\u6eaf\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRLBF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u8bc4\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53d1\u51fa\"\u56de\u6eafx\u4e2atoken\"\u4fe1\u53f7\u540e\u7ee7\u7eed\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff1b2) \u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565BSAFE+\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u539f\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u56de\u6eaf\u80fd\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "RLBF\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u95f4\u586b\u5145\u3001GCG\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b49\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "RLBF\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

Secondly, Modalities adopts modular design with declarative, self-contained configuration, enabling reproducibility and extensibility levels that are difficult to achieve out-of-the-box with existing LLM training frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Modalities\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684PyTorch\u539f\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6b64\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7f16\u5199\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u548c\u811a\u672c\u3002", "method": "1. \u96c6\u6210\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e07\u4ebftoken\u548c\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u3001\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "Modalities\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "Modalities\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684LLM\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \\emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation.

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance.

Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "USBD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9002\u5e94\u6709\u504f\u7684\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SF-GDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5c06\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u539f\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Dirichlet\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u83b7\u4ece\u4f4e\u9891\u805a\u7c7b\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u94fe\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "USBD\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9002\u5e94\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aSF-GDA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss.

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIFLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684IoT\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7logit\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u9632\u5fa1\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728IoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09TinyML\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u9700\u8981\u9632\u5fa1\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u975eIID\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRIFLE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7528logit\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u805a\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165KL\u6563\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u91cf\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff1b3\uff09\u652f\u6301\u5728\u53d7\u9650IoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3VGG-19\u3001Resnet18\u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u975eIID\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff1a1\uff09\u8bef\u62a5\u68c0\u6d4b\u51cf\u5c1187.5%\uff1b2\uff09\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u534762.5%\uff1b3\uff09\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad828.3%\uff1b4\uff09VGG19\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece600\u591a\u5929\u7f29\u77ed\u52301.39\u5c0f\u65f6\uff080.3 GFLOPS\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RIFLE\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86IoT\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\u3002"}}

We term these Rendering-Optimal References (RORs) and analyze their statistical properties, revealing stable patterns: mixture-structured scales and bimodal radiance across diverse scenes. To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\"\u6e32\u67d3\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\"\uff08RORs\uff09\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u7a20\u5bc6\u533a\u57df\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u7531\u70b9\u4e91\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u5219\u9700\u8981\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u89e3\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u89c4\u5f8b\u53ca\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb3D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790RORs\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4ece\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efaRORs\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0RORs\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u5cf0\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7a20\u5bc6\u533a\u57df\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u53c2\u6570\u53d7\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "3DGS\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u70b9\u4e91\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u524d\u9988\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Lindell"], "title": "Grow with the Flow: 4D Reconstruction of Growing Plants with Gaussian Flow Fields", "comment": "Project page: https://weihanluo.ca/growflow/", "summary": "Modeling the time-varying 3D appearance of plants during their growth poses unique challenges: unlike many dynamic scenes, plants generate new geometry over time as they expand, branch, and differentiate. Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6d41\u573a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u6570\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u957f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u5411\u751f\u957f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u65f6\u53d83D\u5916\u89c2\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u4e0e\u8bb8\u591a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u690d\u7269\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5206\u679d\u548c\u5206\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c4D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u9650\u5236\u7ebf\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6d41\u573a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u989c\u8272\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u957f\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u719f\u690d\u7269\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u9006\u5411\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u690d\u7269\u7684\u53d1\u80b2\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u957f\u4e2d3D\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u6d41\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u957f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u690d\u7269\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The aim of this contribution is to study the learning process of a Transformer when applied to MTS by revealing connections to statistical time series methods.

The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings. However, most state-of-the-art methods mainly define EU as disagreement caused by random training initializations, which mostly reflects sensitivity to optimization randomness rather than uncertainty from deeper sources. To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data.

We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLTR\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u524d\u7f00\u80fd\u5426\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4RLVR\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548", "motivation": "RLVR\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u80fd\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u5b83\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u4e4b\u5916\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u80fd\u7ecf\u53d7\u622a\u65ad\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5ef6\u7eed\u7684\u8003\u9a8c", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RLTR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u79fb\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u524d\u7f00\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6307\u5bfc\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u9f13\u52b1LLM\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u771f\u6b63\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406", "result": "RLTR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728MATH500\u4e0a\uff0cRLTR\u6bd4RLVR\u5728Maj@64\u4e0a\u63d0\u53473.6%\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u7ea62.5\u500d\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fbe\u5230RLVR\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "conclusion": "RLTR\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677"}}

This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability. Together, our approach enables more meaningful and practical generation of sports feedback under limited annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891-LLM\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891-LLM\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u4f53\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982BLEU-4\u3001METEOR\u7b49\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u6500\u5ca9\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u6bd4\u8d5b\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u6559\u7ec3\u624b\u518c\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u9988\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u7279\u5f02\u6027(specificity)\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027(actionability)\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4f53\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891-LLM\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

However, existing RLVR methods utilize rollouts in an indiscriminate and short-horizon manner: responses of heterogeneous quality within each prompt are treated uniformly, and historical rollouts are discarded after a single use. This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound. Experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in performance and training efficiency across multiple RLVR optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7684RLVR\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfrollout\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728rollout\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2\uff09\u5386\u53f2rollout\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u5c31\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0", "method": "\u5c06RLVR\u4e2d\u7684rollout\u8c03\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2arollout\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81c2\uff0c\u5176\u5956\u52b1\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u652f\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5386\u53f2rollout\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u7528", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRLVR\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6269\u5927rollout\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u754c", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06rollout\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503crollout\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb"}}

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

Evidence of Alignment and Decoupling in Heterogeneous GNNs", "comment": null, "summary": "Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MetaXplain\u89e3\u91ca\u534f\u8bae\u548cMP-AEA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e2\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\"\u54ea\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\"\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f55\u65f6\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u4f1a\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MetaXplain\u89e3\u91ca\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1)\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c(2)\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6270\u52a8\uff0c(3)\u878d\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51faMP-AEA\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bMP-AEA\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MetaXplain\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u5230\u53bb\u566a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing techniques struggle in faithfully generating the structure and semantics conveyed by complex floorplans that depict large indoor spaces with many rooms and a varying numbers of polygon corners. To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as Structure3D, CubiCasa5K, and Raster2Graph, while also demonstrating strong generalization to more challenging datasets like WAFFLE, which contain diverse room structures and complex geometric variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Raster2Seq\u5c06\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u89d2\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u623f\u95f4\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u89d2\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u5143\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u89d2\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u951a\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728Structure3D\u3001CubiCasa5K\u548cRaster2Graph\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u623f\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u7684WAFFLE\u7b49\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Raster2Seq\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u697c\u5c42\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite its significance in industrial applications such as fraud detection and user segmentation, a significant chasm persists between academic research and real-world deployment. Current evaluation protocols suffer from the small-scale, high-homophily citation datasets, non-scalable full-batch training paradigms, and a reliance on supervised metrics that fail to reflect performance in label-scarce environments. To bridge these gaps, we present PyAGC, a comprehensive, production-ready benchmark and library designed to stress-test AGC methods across diverse scales and structural properties. We unify existing methodologies into a modular Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework and, for the first time, provide memory-efficient, mini-batch implementations for a wide array of state-of-the-art AGC algorithms. Our benchmark curates 12 diverse datasets, ranging from 2.7K to 111M nodes, specifically incorporating industrial graphs with complex tabular features and low homophily. Furthermore, we advocate for a holistic evaluation protocol that mandates unsupervised structural metrics and efficiency profiling alongside traditional supervised metrics.

While effective for in-distribution tasks, we argue that these deterministic paths become brittle under causal interventions, which often require transporting probability mass across low-density regions (\"off-manifold\") where the vector field is ill-defined. This leads to numerical instability and spurious correlations. In this work, we introduce the Causal Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (CSB), a framework that reformulates counterfactual inference as Entropic Optimal Transport. Unlike deterministic approaches that require strict invertibility, CSB leverages diffusion processes (SDEs) to robustly \"tunnel\" through support mismatches while strictly enforcing structural admissibility constraints. We prove the Structural Decomposition Theorem, showing that the global high-dimensional bridge factorizes into local, robust transitions.

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u5408\u5e76\u4e0d\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMerging-ensembling loss (M-Loss)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5c42\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u6d4b\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06M-Loss\u7eb3\u5165\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "M-Loss\u65e2\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53c8\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this context, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a common non-parametric regression algorithm, which achieves efficient performance when compared with other algorithms in literature. In this research effort an optimization of the k-NN algorithm is proposed by exploiting the potentiality of an introduced arithmetic method, which can provide solutions for linear equations involving an arbitrary number of real variables. Specifically, an Arithmetic Method Algorithm (AMA) is adopted to assess the efficiency of the introduced arithmetic method, while an Arithmetic Method Regression (AMR) algorithm is proposed as an optimization of k-NN adopting the potentiality of AMA. Such algorithm is compared with other regression algorithms, according to an introduced optimal inference decision rule, and evaluated on certain real world data sources, which are publicly available.

In practice, deployment requirements often vary across scenarios, necessitating a single policy that can adapt zero-shot to different cost thresholds. However, most existing offline safe RL methods are trained under a pre-specified threshold, yielding policies with limited generalization and deployment flexibility across cost thresholds. Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated. Extensive experiments on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that RCDT consistently improves return--cost trade-offs over representative baselines, advancing the state-of-the-art in offline safe RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "RCDT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "RCDT\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5f0f\u6210\u672c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60e9\u7f5a\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5956\u52b1-\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u548cQ\u503c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u56de\u62a5-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728DSRL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRCDT\u5728\u56de\u62a5-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168RL\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "RCDT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168RL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Current KV cache eviction methods typically rely on instantaneous heuristic metrics, implicitly assuming that score magnitudes are consistent proxies for importance across all heads. However, this overlooks the heterogeneity in predictive fidelity across attention heads. While certain heads prioritize the instantaneous contribution of tokens, others are dedicated to capturing long-horizon utility. In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision. Furthermore, we implement a data-driven offline profiling protocol to facilitate the practical deployment of LU-KV. Extensive evaluations on LongBench and RULER benchmarks demonstrate that LU-KV achieves an 80% reduction in KV cache size with minimal performance degradation, while simultaneously reducing inference latency and GPU memory footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "LU-KV\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6dd8\u6c70\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u5305\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5934\u7ea7\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1180% KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6dd8\u6c70\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ac\u65f6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5206\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u67d0\u4e9b\u5934\u5173\u6ce8token\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5934\u5219\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLU-KV\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5934\u7ea7\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u51f8\u5305\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongBench\u548cRULER\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cLU-KV\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680%\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0cLU-KV\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Owing to the increasing importance of algorithmic fairness, we consider the problem of computing PR vectors subject to various group-fairness criteria based on sensitive attributes of the vertices.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm.

Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDFed\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u672c\u5730-\u5168\u5c40\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5f3a\u5236\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\u4e0b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u6700\u4f18\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "SDFed\u7ef4\u62a4\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u672c\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5176\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u672c\u5730-\u5168\u5c40\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDFed\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SDFed\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u672c\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning.

Unlike prior methods, SDN leverages a semantic embedding space to perform stochastic volumetric exploration, provably providing full support over a local trust region. Complementing this, DBU transforms policy optimization into a stable regression task, decoupling gradient variance from action space cardinality and guaranteeing monotonic policy improvement.

Experiments across image and text tasks, including large language models, confirm that ERIS achieves FedAvg-level accuracy while substantially reducing communication cost and improving robustness to membership inference and reconstruction attacks, without relying on heavy cryptography or noise injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301FedAvg\u7ea7\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4ebf\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5728\u67d0\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u51fa\u727a\u7272\u3002", "method": "ERIS\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u504f\u79fb\u68af\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u74f6\u9888\u5e76\u5206\u5e03\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eERIS\u4e0eFedAvg\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230FedAvg\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ERIS\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u52a0\u5bc6\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u8def\u7531\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3b\"\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\"\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22MoE LLMs\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8def\u7531\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff08RoSais\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6027\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u5c42\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08F-SOUR\uff09\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f93\u5165token\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "result": "1) \u4ec5\u64cd\u7eb5\u9ad8RoSais\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5c31\u80fd\u5c06\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8def\u7531\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-V2-Lite\u4e0a\u5c4f\u853d5\u4e2a\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad84\u500d\u81f30.79\uff09\uff1b2) F-SOUR\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027MoE LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728JailbreakBench\u548cAdvBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.90\u548c0.98\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u6837\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u64cd\u7eb5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u7981\u7528\u548c\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5185\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765MoE LLMs\u7684\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we present CauScale, a neural architecture designed for efficient causal discovery that scales inference to graphs with up to 1000 nodes. CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u65f6\u57df\u3001\u9891\u57df\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528Nyquist\u7ea6\u675f\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u5f02\u5e38\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u57df\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u9891\u7387\u3001\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u6790-\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEFT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81token\uff1a\u9891\u57dftoken\u5d4c\u5165\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65f6\u57dftoken\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6token\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Nyquist\u7ea6\u675f\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u4e3a\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u4ece\u8f83\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLEFT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c115\u500dFLOPs\u548c\u52a0\u901f8\u500d\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LEFT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89c6\u56fetoken\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u8de8\u4e92\u8865\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Test-time latent optimization can unlock substantially better reward-guided generations from pretrained generative models, but it is prone to reward hacking that degrades quality and also too slow for practical use.

Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \\log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time.

Furthermore, Geo-IQL does not degrade performance on stable manifolds. Crucially, we validate our algorithm on the MIMIC-III Sepsis critical care dataset. While standard IQL collapses to behaviour cloning, Geo-IQL demonstrates active policy improvement.

However, most existing synthesis strategies focus on maintaining statistical information. Although some studies address prediction performance guarantees, their single-stage synthesis designs make it challenging to balance the privacy requirements that necessitate significant perturbations and the prediction performance that is sensitive to such perturbations. We propose a two-stage synthesis strategy. In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance. We validate our approach and demonstrate its characteristics of being statistics-driven and restricted in achieving the privacy--prediction trade-off both theoretically and numerically.

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT. We validate this theoretical insight through a set of experiments on both image and text generation tasks. We demonstrate that min-max methods consistently achieve fairer outcomes compared to other approaches from the literature, while maintaining competitive overall performance for both tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49EGT\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7b80\u5355\u7684min-max\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684f\u6563\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3b\u8981\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u800c\u6765\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165equalized generative treatment\uff08EGT\uff09\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003f\u6563\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5fc5\u7136\u5c06\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6700\u96be\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684min-max\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684f\u6563\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cmin-max\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EGT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0cmin-max\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed.

While recent runtime defenses attempt to disrupt this process via output perturbation, most either require access to model parameters or fail when attackers adapt their tactics. In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDashed Line Defense (DLD)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u62b5\u5fa1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u635f\u5931\u503c\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u6765\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u9632\u5fa1\u4e5f\u80fd\u88ab\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDashed Line Defense (DLD)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u503c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u963b\u6b62\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "DLD\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0cDLD\u4e5f\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "DLD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing KV compression methods rely either on static thresholds and attention-only heuristics or on coarse memory budget allocation. Under tight memory budgets, these methods overlook two key factors: prompt-dependent variation in compression risk and functional heterogeneity across attention heads, which destabilize token selection and lead to tail failures. To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds.

While training the denoiser on real-world data is computationally demanding, the sampling procedure itself is more flexible. This adaptability serves as a key lever in practice, enabling improvements in both the quality of generated samples and the efficiency of the sampling process. In this work, we introduce an inverse reinforcement learning framework for learning sampling strategies without retraining the denoiser. We formulate the diffusion sampling procedure as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where actions correspond to optional modifications of the sampling dynamics. To optimize action scheduling, we avoid defining an explicit reward function. Instead, we directly match the target behavior expected from the sampler using policy gradient techniques. We provide experimental evidence that this approach can improve the quality of samples generated by pretrained diffusion models and automatically tune sampling hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u9009\u4fee\u6539\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u6837\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, transitioning DRL from laboratory simulations to bespoke cyber environments can introduce numerous issues. This is further exacerbated by the often adversarial, non-stationary, and partially-observable nature of most cybersecurity tasks. In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for each pitfall to support the development of more rigorous and deployable DRL-based security systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u768411\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679066\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86DRL\u5e94\u7528\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1. \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86DRL4Sec\u6587\u732e\u4e2d11\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b2. \u5206\u6790\u4e862018-2025\u5e74\u95f466\u7bc7\u91cd\u8981\u8bba\u6587\uff1b3. \u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u73af\u5883\uff08\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3001Web\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5e73\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u8fc75\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5404\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684DRL\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aDRL\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9488\u5bf911\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u7f3a\u9677\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347DRL\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc1\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u6574\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u5206\u79bb\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u52a8\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u62df\u5408\u5305\u542b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u906e\u6321\u610f\u8bc6\u56db\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\u3002\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc1\u636e\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u9009\u62e9\u6620\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u9760\u62e2\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f46\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Noise is ubiquitous in data used to train large language models, but it is not well understood whether these models are able to correctly generalize to inputs generated without noise. Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions. Overall, we find that transformers are particularly ineffective for learning boolean functions in the presence of feature noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformers\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u968f\u673ak-juntas\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5373\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83Transformer\u548cLSTM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\uff08k-\u7a00\u758f\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u3001\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u968f\u673ak-juntas\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u5728k-\u7a00\u758f\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u968f\u673ak-juntas\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5e03\u5c14\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f4e\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u89e3\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9879\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9Transformer\u9003\u8131\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u5bf9\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5176\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries.

Sanchez"], "title": "Foundation Inference Models for Ordinary Differential Equations", "comment": null, "summary": "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are central to scientific modelling, but inferring their vector fields from noisy trajectories remains challenging. Current approaches such as symbolic regression, Gaussian process (GP) regression, and Neural ODEs often require complex training pipelines and substantial machine learning expertise, or they depend strongly on system-specific prior knowledge. We propose FIM-ODE, a pretrained Foundation Inference Model that amortises low-dimensional ODE inference by predicting the vector field directly from noisy trajectory data in a single forward pass. We pretrain FIM-ODE on a prior distribution over ODEs with low-degree polynomial vector fields and represent the target field with neural operators. FIM-ODE achieves strong zero-shot performance, matching and often improving upon ODEFormer, a recent pretrained symbolic baseline, across a range of regimes despite using a simpler pretraining prior distribution. Pretraining also provides a strong initialisation for finetuning, enabling fast and stable adaptation that outperforms modern neural and GP baselines without requiring machine learning expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIM-ODE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u7ef4ODE\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u644a\u9500\u5316", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65adODE\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff09\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6216\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFIM-ODE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7684ODE\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u91cf\u573a", "result": "FIM-ODE\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u7ecf\u5e38\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u8fd1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u7ebfODEFormer\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u548cGP\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "FIM-ODE\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u4e86ODE\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272"}}

Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the main architecture for SAT solving, due to the natural graph representation of Boolean formulas. We analyze the expressive power of GNNs for SAT solving through the lens of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test. As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNNs\u5728SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eWL\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790GNN\u5728SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7WL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76GNN\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3SAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Weisfeiler-Leman\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6790GNN\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u9636WL\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76WL\u6709\u754c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6b63\u5219\u3001\u968f\u673a\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728G4SAT\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSAT\u7ade\u8d5b\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5b8c\u6574WL\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5927\u591a\u53ef\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d4b\u503c\uff0cWL\u6709\u754c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136GNN\u5728SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u53d7WL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1aSAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8aWL\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b"}}

Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views.

However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures.

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\uff08\u5982scikit-learn\uff09\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u76f4\u89c2\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u622a\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2aBO\u540e\u7aef\uff08BoTorch\u3001Optuna\u3001Scikit-Optimize\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff09\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u6ca1\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff08p\u503c\u8303\u56f40.141-0.908\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u56f4\u7ed5\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u65e9\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u6682\u65f6\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u672a\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5c06\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a unified approach, defining a compact metric on the space of graphs of all sizes, both sparse and dense, under which MPNNs are H\u00f6lder continuous.

Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "How2Everything\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5305\u542bHow2Mine\u4ece\u7f51\u9875\u6316\u6398\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3001How2Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u3001How2Score\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u9010\u6b65\"\u5982\u4f55\u505a\"\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662fLLM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "1) How2Mine\uff1a\u4ece98\u4e07\u7f51\u9875\u4e2d\u6316\u639835.1\u4e07\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d614\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\uff1b2) How2Bench\uff1a\u6784\u5efa7K\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\uff1b3) How2Score\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u963b\u788d\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\uff1b4) \u5c06\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a8B\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b5) \u4f7f\u7528How2Score\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "1) How2Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6269\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528How2Score\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5c06How2Bench\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347>10\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6ca1\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff1b3) \u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u89c4\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b4) \u84b8\u998f\u76848B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u8fbe\u523080.5%\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "How2Everything\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their increasing computational demands during training and deployment translates directly into high energy consumption.

In this paper, we briefly survey efficient deep learning methods for biometric applications.

In recent years, multiple LRNN-based architectures have been proposed, each introducing distinct parameterizations, discretization schemes, and implementation constraints. However, existing implementations are fragmented across different software frameworks, often rely on framework-specific optimizations, and in some cases require custom CUDA kernels or lack publicly available code altogether. As a result, using, comparing, or extending LRNNs requires substantial implementation effort. To address this, we introduce $\\texttt{lrnnx}$, a unified software library that implements several modern LRNN architectures under a common interface. The library exposes multiple levels of control, allowing users to work directly with core components or higher-level model abstractions. $\\texttt{lrnnx}$ aims to improve accessibility, reproducibility, and extensibility of LRNN research and applications.

Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "FRPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684RLHF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5728KL\u6709\u754c\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RLHF\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u4e4b\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6807\u51c6RLHF\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684RLHF\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7max-min\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684KL\u6709\u754c\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFRPO\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff08SFT\u548cRL\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b66RL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cFRPO\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FRPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5fae\u8c03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

However, these licenses carry mandatory requirements: include the full license text, provide a copyright notice, and preserve upstream attribution, that remain unverified at scale. Failure to meet these conditions can place reuse outside the scope of the license, effectively leaving AI artifacts under default copyright for those uses and exposing downstream users to litigation. We call this phenomenon ``permissive washing'': labeling AI artifacts as free to use, while omitting the legal documentation required to make that label actionable. To assess how widespread permissive washing is in the AI supply chain, we empirically audit 124,278 dataset $\\rightarrow$ model $\\rightarrow$ application supply chains, spanning 3,338 datasets, 6,664 models, and 28,516 applications across Hugging Face and GitHub.

Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy.

Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks. For our experiments, we build on FlexOlmo and turn its pre-trained experts into low-rank versions. Our regression analysis from expert rank to downstream task performance reveals that the best-performing rank is substantially higher for reasoning-heavy benchmarks than for knowledge-heavy benchmarks. These findings on rank sensitivity come with direct implications for memory efficiency: Using optimal ranks, FlexMoRE yields improved downstream task performance (average score $47.18$) compared to the baseline FlexOlmo-style mixture of full-sized experts (average score $45.46$) at less than one third the parameters ($10.75$B for FlexMoRE vs. $33.27$B for FlexOlmo).

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning.

In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\\% avg@16 and +4.6\\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\\% avg@16 and +13.1\\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes.

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization.

These findings have enabled improved understanding of the expressive capacity and generalization abilities of Transformers. In particular, Transformers have been suggested to length-generalize exactly on problems that have simple RASP programs. However, it remains open whether trained models actually implement simple interpretable programs. In this paper, we present a general method to extract such programs from trained Transformers. The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program. In experiments on small Transformers trained on algorithmic and formal language tasks, we show that our method often recovers simple and interpretable RASP programs from length-generalizing transformers.

The proposed distance incorporates a tunable scaling parameter, $t$, that controls the sensitivity to global structure (small $t$) and finer details (large $t$). We prove several theoretical properties of magnitude distance, including its limiting behavior across scales and conditions under which it satisfies key metric properties. In contrast to classical distances, we show that magnitude distance remains discriminative in high-dimensional settings when the scale is appropriately tuned. We further demonstrate how magnitude distance can be used as a training objective for push-forward generative models.

We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions.

While allocation policies aim to maximize population-level outcomes, current approaches often fail to account for the dynamic arrival of organs and the composition of waitlisted candidates, thereby hampering efficiency. The United States is transitioning from rigid, rule-based allocation to more flexible data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for non-myopic policy optimization in general online matching relying on potentials, a concept originally introduced for kidney exchange. We develop scalable and accurate ways of learning potentials that are higher-dimensional and more expressive than prior approaches. Our approach is a form of self-supervised imitation learning: the potentials are trained to mimic an omniscient algorithm that has perfect foresight. We focus on the application of heart transplant allocation and demonstrate, using real historical data, that our policies significantly outperform prior approaches -- including the current US status quo policy and the proposed continuous distribution framework -- in optimizing for population-level outcomes. Our analysis and methods come at a pivotal moment in US policy, as the current heart transplant allocation system is under review.

Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SimpliPy\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u6bd4SymPy\u5feb100\u500d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u644a\u9500\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Flash-ANSR\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u644a\u9500\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5feb\u901f\u5c06\u7b49\u4ef7\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4ee3\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982SymPy\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSimpliPy\u89c4\u5219\u7b80\u5316\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4SymPy\u5feb100\u500d\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaFlash-ANSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u7b49\u4ef7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5728FastSRB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFlash-ANSR\u6bd4\u644a\u9500\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08NeSymReS\u3001E2E\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PySR\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u65f6\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u975e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SimpliPy\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7b80\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u644a\u9500\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation methods apply interventions uniformly, degrading performance on the majority of tokens that generalize normally. We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \\times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives.

In contrast, we argue that with a well-chosen D'(x), the shift can be positive and make learning easier -- a perspective called Positive Distribution Shift (PDS). Such a perspective is central to contemporary machine learning, where much of the innovation is in finding good training distributions D'(x), rather than changing the training algorithm.

In such settings, multiple distinct sparse subsets may explain the response equally well. Identifying these alternatives is crucial for generating domain-specific insights into the underlying mechanisms, yet conventional methods typically isolate a single solution, obscuring the full spectrum of plausible explanations.\n  We present GEMSS (Gaussian Ensemble for Multiple Sparse Solutions), a variational Bayesian framework specifically designed to simultaneously discover multiple, diverse sparse feature combinations. The method employs a structured spike-and-slab prior for sparsity, a mixture of Gaussians to approximate the intractable multimodal posterior, and a Jaccard-based penalty to further control solution diversity. Unlike sequential greedy approaches, GEMSS optimizes the entire ensemble of solutions within a single objective function via stochastic gradient descent.\n  The method is validated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 128 synthetic experiments across classification and regression tasks. Results demonstrate that GEMSS scales effectively to high-dimensional settings ($p=5000$) with sample size as small as $n = 50$, generalizes seamlessly to continuous targets, handles missing data natively, and exhibits remarkable robustness to class imbalance and Gaussian noise.\n  GEMSS is available as a Python package 'gemss' at PyPI.

Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance.

As the training scale increases, the network often becomes a bottleneck, motivating reducing the volume of transmitted data. Accordingly, recent systems demonstrated significant acceleration of the training process using gradient quantization. However, these systems are not optimized for multi-hop aggregation, where entries are partially summed multiple times along their aggregation topology.\n  This paper presents DynamiQ, a quantization framework that bridges the gap between quantization best practices and multi-hop aggregation. DynamiQ introduces novel techniques to better represent partial sums, co-designed with a decompress-accumulate-recompress fused kernel to facilitate fast execution.\n  We extended PyTorch DDP to support DynamiQ over NCCL P2P, and across different LLMs, tasks, and scales, we demonstrate consistent improvement of up to 34.2% over the best among state-of-the-art methods such as Omni-Reduce, THC, and emerging standards such as MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8. Further, DynamiQ is the only evaluated method that consistently reaches near-baseline accuracy (e.g., 99.9% of the BF16 baseline) and does so while significantly accelerating the training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynamiQ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8df3\u5168\u5f52\u7ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8df3\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6761\u76ee\u5728\u805a\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u591a\u6b21\u90e8\u5206\u6c42\u548c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynamiQ\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u89e3\u538b-\u7d2f\u52a0-\u518d\u538b\u7f29\u878d\u5408\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u6267\u884c\u3002\u6269\u5c55PyTorch DDP\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8eNCCL P2P\u7684DynamiQ\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0cDynamiQ\u76f8\u6bd4Omni-Reduce\u3001THC\u3001MXFP4/6/8\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe34.2%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5982BF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u768499.9%\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamiQ\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u591a\u8df3\u805a\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Code available", "summary": "AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57282D\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5f52\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u7ed9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57282D\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u683c\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u96be\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5927\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5176\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u7ec4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u5173\u6ce8\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u652f\u6301\u5373\u65f6\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9760\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u63cf\u8ff0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u8ffd\u6c42\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u7701\u5f0f\u68c0\u67e5\uff08\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff09\u6765\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve distributions that remain consistent to the nominal distribution while being diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose generative model-based ambiguity sets that capture various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution.

However, real-world systems, from shifting financial cycles to elastic biological rhythms, frequently exhibit \"time-warped\" dynamics where the effective flow of time decouples from the sampling index. In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions. We implement this mechanism in StretchTime, a multivariate forecasting architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness on datasets exhibiting non-stationary temporal dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSymplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE)\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dTransformer\u5bf9\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfRoPE\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u5468\u671f\u3001\u751f\u7269\u8282\u5f8b\uff09\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\"\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\"\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5373\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u7d22\u5f15\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u5c55\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eRoPE\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u975e\u4eff\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faSymplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE)\uff0c\u4ece\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u65cb\u8f6c\u7fa4SO(2)\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u8f9b\u7fa4Sp(2,R)\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5730\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5f20\u6216\u6536\u7f29\u65f6\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff1b4. \u5b9e\u73b0StretchTime\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u626d\u66f2\u51fd\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5c55\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SyPE\u4e25\u683c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86RoPE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score.

Existing routers typically rely on non-differentiable Top-$k$+Softmax, limiting their performance and scalability. We argue that two distinct decisions, which experts to activate and how to distribute expert contributions among them, are conflated in standard Top-$k$+Softmax. We introduce Dirichlet-Routed MoE (DirMoE), a novel end-to-end differentiable routing mechanism built on a Dirichlet variational autoencoder framework. This design fundamentally disentangles the core routing problems: expert selection, modeled by a Bernoulli component, and expert contribution among chosen experts, handled by a Dirichlet component.

While yielding substantial performance gains, a fundamental question arises: can we develop new paradigms beyond orthogonalization, pushing the efficiency frontier further? We present \\textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias. Under this protocol, ARO consistently outperforms AdamW (by 1.3 $\\sim$1.35$\\times$) and orthogonalization methods (by 1.1$\\sim$1.15$\\times$) in LLM pretraining at up to 8B activated parameters, and up to $8\\times$ overtrain budget, without evidence of diminishing returns.

Giannakis"], "title": "ANCRe: Adaptive Neural Connection Reassignment for Efficient Depth Scaling", "comment": null, "summary": "Scaling network depth has been a central driver behind the success of modern foundation models, yet recent investigations suggest that deep layers are often underutilized. This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective. Rigorous analysis proves that the layout of residual connections can fundamentally shape convergence behavior, and even induces an exponential gap in convergence rates. Prompted by this insight, we introduce adaptive neural connection reassignment (ANCRe), a principled and lightweight framework that parameterizes and learns residual connectivities from the data. ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth. Extensive numerical tests across pre-training of large language models, diffusion models, and deep ResNets demonstrate consistently accelerated convergence, boosted performance, and enhanced depth efficiency over conventional residual connections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u63a5\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff08ANCRe\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5e03\u5c40\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5316\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u5e03\u5c40\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5e03\u5c40\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u9020\u6210\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u63a5\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff08ANCRe\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5e03\u5c40\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e76\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6ResNets\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0cANCRe\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff1b4\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff08<1%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5e03\u5c40\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002ANCRe\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like \"Bingo\". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent \"Cognitive Gap\" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Next-Gen CAPTCHAs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\"\u8ba4\u77e5\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u7684\u7834\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u62b5\u5fa1\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5982Gemini3-Pro-High\u548cGPT-5.2-Xhigh\uff09\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u65e0\u9650\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f4\u89c9\u800c\u975e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u7acb\u751f\u7269\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u4ee3\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "Next-Gen CAPTCHAs\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u77e5\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}
